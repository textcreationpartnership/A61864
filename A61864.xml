            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> acknowledge, that, of all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in this world, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of that importance vnto man, as the ſaying of his ſoule, and that Salvation cannot be obtaynd, without the true Faith and Religion; yet manifeſt experience dayly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that many thowſands do carrie themſelvs ſo ſlouthfully in that moſt important affaire of Religion; as if it were a matter of the leaſt, or rather of no conſequence. For we ſee, that, in whatſoever Error or Hereſy (though never ſo monſtrous) men are bred for the moſt part they continew in the ſame; or els, according to the mutability of their Inconſtant Leaders, they paſſe after them, from one falshood, into
<pb facs="tcp:43743:3"/> another; without making any further ſearch for the Truth. This is truly one of the greateſt miſeries, and the moſt deplorable follie of man; that he should be ſo ſlouthfull, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, in theſe things, which concern his eternal Salvation; whereas he is ſo diligent &amp; carefull, about his Temporall affaires, which are incomparably of leſſer moment. Neither is this negligence &amp; follie proper only to the rude and ignorant; but it is alſo very ordinarie to many, who are neither fooles, nor vitious; but rather have good ſtore of worldly wiſdom, and of Moral vertues.</p>
            <p>This then, being vndenyably the common Lethargie, of almoſt all thoſe, who live in the falſe Religions and ſects of perdition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the world is now peſtered: it is no ſmall favour, which they receive, who, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin mercy, are awakned out of that dead ſleep; and, being made to open their eys, do ſee their own danger; and ſeeing it, ſtrive, by all means, to free themſelvs of it, by ſeeking earneſtly, with imploring the divin aſſiſtance, the right way vnto eternal happineſſe. This favour God hath been pleaſed to vouchſafe lately, vnto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Proteſtants, in Scotland, awakning them, by the great Confuſion and Diviſion (moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and Natural Marks of Falshood) that had falne vpon their Religion; and by the grievous Diſſenſions, that have been rageing a long time, amongſt their inconſtant Teachers. And amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngſt others, he was pleaſed to graunt this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour vnto a certain honorable perſonnage, who
<pb facs="tcp:43743:3"/> had been a very zealous Proteſtant, relying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vpon the Miniſters words: But, ſo ſoon as he ſaw their horrible contradictions &amp; Diſſenſions, and that they condemned &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, what themſelvs had before taught &amp; practized; yea and furiouſly enforced others to follow them, and ſwear to all their Innovations, replenishing, in the mean time, the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with vnſpeakable miſeries &amp; calamities; he thought it was not fitting, nor ſecure for him, to truſt any longer theſe Inconſtant Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, in a iourney of ſuch importance; ſince he could not prudently truſt Guides, of ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, in an earthly Voyage. Wherefore, being thus awakned, and not a ſtranger from good letters, he did ſet himſelf ſeriouſly to ſeek the Truth; chooſing the Divin Scriptures for his Rule, and the Holy Fathers for Interpreters of the ſame: by which means he conceived, that he should attayn vnto the knowledge of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice &amp; beleef of the Primitive Church: which, by all ſides, is acknowledged, to have been the true Church. And ſo beginning his ſearch, with the Trial of the Innovations, which were lately introduced by the Presbyterians, he did not only ſoone find them, to be againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures &amp; holy Fathers; but alſo he began to ſee a glimſe of the Truth of the Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which he had heard ſo often defamed by the Miniſters. For he clearly perceived, by pervſing eſpecially ſome peeces of S. Auguſtins works, and the Proteſtants Apologie, that the holy Fathers &amp; Primitive Church beleeved di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb facs="tcp:43743:4"/> points, which are condemned by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and are ſtill beleeved by Catholiques; whereat he was not a little aſtonished: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when he ſaw this acknowledged by the chief Divines of the late English Church, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich pretended, above all others, to be moſt conformable vnto the primi ive times: whoſe Teſtimonies are diligently collected by M. Breirly, in the forementioned Apologie.</p>
            <p>Having then thus ſeen the great deformity of the Scottish Presbyteian Kirk, which is ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nſtrouſly different from the Primitive; and the great prevarication of the late English Church; he remained, for ſome time, in great perplexity of mind, not being able of himſelf, to overcome ſome difficulties &amp; preiudices, which had been a long time beaten into his eares, againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Religion: Till at length, falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the acquentance of a Roman Catholique, whom he perceived to be ſomewhat verſed in theſe queſtions; he was pleaſed, to vnfold his mind to him; and after diverſe conferences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not only full ſatisfaction of his doubts; but alſo was inſtructed in the chief principles, and immoveable grounds, of the Catholique faith: whereby, he ſaw alſo the ſandy grounds of the Proteſtant Religion. Being therefore in end fully reſolved, to enter into the boſome of the holy Catholique Church; he deſired, the ſaid Catholique would be pleaſed firſt, to draw vp in ſome few sheets, the Occaſion &amp; Motives of his Converſion; to the end, that, having theſe papers by him, he might be more able to give
<pb facs="tcp:43743:4"/> ſatisfaction to others, who might enquire of him, the reaſons of his change. Which was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne accordingly, with intention only that it mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht ſerve for his private vſe. But ſome other zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Catholiques, coming thereafter to the ſight of theſe papers, were of opinion, that they might prove profitable to others; if the ſame Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de being obſerved, the matters there touched, were a little more enlarged, and then published. And therefore they ioyntly deſired, the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique would be pleaſed, to vndertake that labour; giving him good hopes, that, not only the new Converted Catholiques would be the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby confirmed; but alſo, others, who were ſeeking the Truth, might be helped and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; beſides ſome other goods, which they th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought might redound from it. In obedience to whoſe Deſires, this labour was vndertaken, by him; &amp; now it is his earneſt wish, that it may anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer their expectation, albeit perhaps, for that end, ſome more time had been requiſite.</p>
            <p>Thus, Courteous Reader, thou haſt heard the occaſion of writing this book: Now, thou maiſt be pleaſed, to ſee a little the Model and Methode of it. In the firſt place, are ſet down the Occaſions of that Honorable new Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rts doubts, concerning the Truth of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion; ſuch as are the Miniſters Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Doctrin &amp; Diſciplin, their great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions and Diviſions, Their Tyrannizing over mens Conſciences, Their Contradicting their own Principles &amp;c. In which matters, ſome late hiſtories or paſſages are interlaced, without
<pb facs="tcp:43743:5"/> expreſſing the names of perſons therein concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; becauſe that was not neceſſary, ſince the things here touched are publique, late, &amp; fresh in all mens knowledge and Memories, within the Countrey; and the perſons alſo well enou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh known: Neither is it the digrace of any mens perſons,<note place="margin">Hier. Apolog. <hi>3.</hi> cont. Ruffin. c. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> which S. Hierom calls the Machines of Heretiques, but the correction of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which is here intended. After the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the doubts is shewed, in ſome few cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters; then followeth the Triall of the laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Presbyterian Reformation, in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points thereof: as its condemning of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, the abolishing the hymne of Glory to the Father, &amp;c. the denying the Apoſtolical authority of the Apoſtles Creed; neglecting to ſay our Lords Prayer, &amp;c. In all which points, the Presbyterians are found to go againſt the word of God, &amp; the Primitive Church; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrines &amp; practiſes of many among the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mſelvs; againſt their firſt Reformers, and many learned Proteſtants: So that this laſt pretended Reformation is shewed, to be nothing, but a reall Deformation, deſtroying, not only the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique office &amp; government, eſtablished by Chriſt, in his Church: but alſo the two chief Pillars, or heads of the Chriſtian Religion: to witt our Lords Prayer, and the Apoſtles Creed. Then followeth the Trial of the firſt pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reformation, which is alſo shewed, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve deſtroyed in effect, the other two chief Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Chriſtianity: to witt, the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and Holy Sacraments: and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
<pb facs="tcp:43743:5"/> brought in a moſt Erroneous doctrin of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith only; expreſly againſt the Scriptures &amp; holy Fathers. So that theſe two pretended Reformations are shown, to have made vp, between them, the hideous work of Deſolation. After this, the whole Proteſtant Church, by the vndenyable principle of the perpetuity of Chriſts Church, is proved, not to be the true Church of Chriſt: And by the ſame vndenyable principle, the Church in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Sea of Rome, and she alone, is demonſtrated, to be the true Catholique Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch of Chriſt, and to have, in all ages, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ſame doctrin, which she received from Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles; notwithſtanding the calumnies of Heretiques. Then laſtly, the ſame truth is proved by the Marks, whereby the true Church is clearly deſigned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; as by her Vnity, Sanctity, Vniverſality, &amp; Apoſtolical Succeſſion: by which marks, the holy Fathers alſo did prove the true Church, in their times. To which is ſubioyned a brief Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Preſbyterian Covenant, or Confeſſion of Faith; which, although it was much Idolatrized of late, is shewed to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a Denyall and Abiuration of the holy Faith, with many execrations and blaſphemies, againſt it. This briefly (Courteous Reader) is the Scope and Methode of the enſuing Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which, the Author thereof earneſtly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes, may tend to thy profit: That, if thou be a new Converted Catholique, thou mayſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Ioſeph did acknowledge in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the experience of this truth, when he ſaid to his brethren, who had vnnaturally ſold him: <hi>you thought euil againſt me,</hi>

                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 50. <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>but God hath turn'd it vnto good, that he might exalt me, as you ſee this day, and preſerue much people.</hi> But this truth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43743:10"/> is more admirably ſeen in that moſt horrible crime of the Iewes, of crucifying the Lord of glory; out of which God did extract the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all goods; to wit the Exaltation of Chriſt, and the Redemption of mankind.</p>
               <p>Since then that Hereſy is confeſſed by all Chriſtians, not only to be evill, but one of the greateſt evils, as being the corruption of a moſt excellent good, to witt the divine faith: Gods goodneſſe would never permitt it to ariſe, and for a tyme to continue againſt the true faith, &amp; the holy Church; vnleſſe he cowld and did make it tend to the good of both. S. Paul tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth this matter, when he ſaith to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Hereſies muſt be, that they which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved may be made manifeſt among you.</hi> That they muſt be; proceeds, by the permiſſion of God, from the vickedneſſe, and free choiſe of man, and from the malice of the Devill, whom our Saviour calls the Enemy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 13.26.</note> who ſowes tares in the field, where he had ſowen the good ſeed. That Hereſies are turn'd into good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the goodneſſe, and ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, who of evil worketh good; as he doth here, making hereſies tend to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of thoſe, who are approved, and conſtant in the faith.</p>
               <p>But the providence and goodneſſe of God is ſpecially wonderfull in this matter, that he doth not only draw good from Hereſy, but alſo he makes it, againſt its owne nature &amp; intent, to ſerve for the further manifeſtation of the truth: and he turn's all the plots and cunning deſign's of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43743:10"/> the Authours and Promoovers of falshood, to the ruine and confuſion both of it, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and to the exaltation, of that, whereof they intended ſo eagerly the deſtruction. This was evident of old in the Arrians; who vſed all ſlight and might to obſcure, and extinguish, the great myſtery of the holy Trinity.

               <p>Theſe things, for the moſt part, are now (by the goodneſſe of God) become very evident in the Scottish Covenant, and Presbytery, which proſpered ſo much for a time: and yet at leuth are come to nought, notwithſtanding all the wiſe &amp; deepe plots that were ſo ſubtilly deuiſed for the ſtanding and aduancing of them: And notwithſtanding the great power of Armies, which did raiſe, and vphold them in theſe Nations: And by which they should in a Martial, rather then Apoſtolique manner haue been propagated troughout the world, as the Miniſters, &amp; ſome others fondly imagined, but more foolishly bragged. The great Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo haue been much diſappoynted, and come short of their deſign's. There was nothing, wherein they ſo much gloryed, as in their proſperity, and in the ruine, which fell vpon all their oppoſers; whereby they avowed publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43743:11"/> and frequently, that their cauſe was clearly owned by Heauen. All their diſcourſes, and ſermons, were nothing but Panegyriques of that great ingyring light (as they tearm'd it) which God had made shyne to them, above all other Nations. They did bragge not a litle, that they were Gods Covenanted people, and he their Covenanting God, which high privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no nation elſe could claime. Their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in their counſels, &amp; diligence in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were highly eſteem'd, and much cry'd vp by many. There ſeem'd nothing in humane prudence fitting for the advancment of their cauſe, but they try'd it: And nothing could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare a croſſe, and hinderance to their deſigns, but they provyded for it. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all theſe pretended priuiledges, exploits, and diligences: the Covenanting Presbyterians haue been brought to confuſion, their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo much bragged of, hath quickly turn'd into adverſity, and their ſelf conceated wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43743:12"/>
               <p>Whilſt there was nothing, but ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle jarres betwixt the Bishops and a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, for conformity to the 5. articles of Perth: which concerned kneeling at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, privat Baptiſme, Confirmation of children, obſervation of Chriſtmaſſe, and of ſome few feſtival dayes; I was never moved to doubt of the religion publiquely profeſſed. For theſe diſſenſions were not, (as I conceaved) in ſubſtantial points: neither was the manner of them very vehement and rigorous, by reaſon of the Bishops temper, who did not vrge theſe things violently, though eſtablish'd both by) Eccleſiaſtical and Civil lawes. Beſid's the Miniſters who oppos'd them were but few, and not conſiderable, either for learning or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in regard of thoſe, who were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary iudgement. All this time, I liv'd in a deepe ſecurity, in an implicit faith of the Church of of Scotland, and its doctrine; imagining that it was the very ſame, which was taught by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. But ſo ſoone as that great ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the Covenant did ariſe, none got leave to ſleep any longer at reſt, in that barke: all were awakned by theſe unskilfull Mariners, to whom we had rashly truſted our ſoules: who fell at ſuch oddes and diſſenſions amongſt themſelv's, that hardly ever ſuch confuſion and noiſe was heard or ſeen: every one of them contradicting, condemning and accurſing another, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch factions, that they ſeem'd to thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing but blood, with which they may be ſufficiently glutted, ſince they begun. This
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43743:12"/> tempeſt and confuſion hath brought ſuch shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pwracke vpon the Church (to ſpeak nothing of the miſeries of the Countrey) that many of ſound iudgement, ſeing the danger, haue been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd to abandon that confus'd and ſinking veſſell, and putt themſelv's in one more ſolidly built, and govern'd by more ſober, wiſe, and diſcreet Pilots.</p>
               <p>This confuſion was the occaſion of my firſt doubt, which made me begin to examin the particular points of theſe new diſſenſſions; and to try the ground, whereon our religion, ſo eaſily shaken, was weakly founded. And fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that all was built vpon the ſand, I made there after a diligent ſearch, to find out that true religion, and holy Church, which Chriſt the wiſe Maſter builder had promiſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to build vpon a Rocke, which could not be shaken; neither by the deceits of men, nor by the power &amp; malice of the Devil.</p>
               <p>Having then after a ſerious, equitable and zealous ſearch of the truth, found it by Gods grace, to be, where the Miniſters clamours, and my education made me leaſt ſuſpect it was: And therefore being to abandon that religion, and particular new, inconſtant confus'd Church, wherein I was bred; and to incorporat my ſelf into the vniuerſal, ancient, perpetual and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable Church, protected alway's from heaven, againſt the gates of Hell; I thought fitting to to recollect the occaſion and reaſons of my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py change: both for the contentment of my own mind, that I may briefly ſee, what I have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43743:13"/> long and diligently ſought after; and for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of others, who perhaps may imagine I had done rashly, deſiring earneſtly God may be glorifyed in both.</p>
               <p>The reaſons, which mov'd me to think ſtrange of our religion, were theſe following, all which I ſaw with my eyes. 1. The Miniſters Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Doctrine. 2. Their Diſſenſions 3. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting their owne Principales. 4. Their Cruelty over mens conſciences. 5. Diſobedience to Civil Magiſtrats, with a shew of Godlineſſe, without any effect or truth of it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Miniſters Inconſtancy; and of the Alterations made by the late Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Reformation.</head>
               <p>THERE is hardly any thing that makes people to ſtumble more at religion, then the often changing of it: and nothing makes them more apprehenſive of their Paſtours fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, then their levity and inconſtancy in their doctrines and practiſes. For how can people think that religion true and ſolid, which they ſee is never conſtant, but is alway's changing like the Moone? And how can they but ſuſpect their Paſtours to be falſe prophets, whom they heare at diverſe times teaching them contrary doctrines? For it's evident by the light of reaſon, that ſuch lighsneſſe and inconſtancy, eſpecially,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43743:13"/> when it is accompayn'd with a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of their own former doctrines and practiſes, is a reall open confeſſion of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer errours, if not of formal deceit's. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it shewes them to be either deceitfull, or at leaſt blind Guides, to neither of which, can people either prudently or ſafely intruſt, their ſoules. If ſuch wandering and erring Guides, after ſome experience had of them, would not be followed nor truſted in earthly voyages: How much leſſe are theſe to be followed or truſted in our voyage to heaven, which is of greater concernment?</p>
               <p>As lightneſſe and inconſtancy are farre from the office of true Apoſtles, ſo they are alwayes proper to falſe Teachers and Prophets. S. Paul writing to the Corinthians freeth himſelf, and other true paſtours from ſuch imputations.<note place="margin">

It is was in him.</hi> But vpon the other part the ſame S. Paul writing to Timothee, shewes that all falſe Teachers are light and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant. <hi>Evil men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 3.</note> ſaith he, <hi>and ſeducers proſper to the worſe: erring &amp; driving into errour.</hi> This is the worſt &amp; moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable kinde of inconſtancy, which proceeds from evil to worſe: which is too evident in the Presbyterians, who haue abrogated condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deformed many things, which their firſt Reformers had left vntouched, allowed and practiſed, as shall be preſently ſeen. For
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43743:14"/> vnder vaine imagination of a new Reformation, they haue gone further from the truth; and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of attayning greater purity, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve plung'd themſelves more deeply into the puddle of errour.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, they changed the governement of the Church by Bishops which had continued a good time, and was eſtablished both by Civil and Eccleſiaſtique lawes: yea, they did not only change and abrogate the governement of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops; but they condemned alſo their very office as vnlawfull and Antichriſtian; and forced others to ſwear and ſubſcribe to their ſentence. And in place of Epiſcopacy, they brought in a parity of Miniſters, and a forme of diſcipline, which they call Presbytery: Declaring that this was the only governement conforme to the word of God, and which Chriſt had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd for his Church: to which ſentence alſo all behoved to ſweare, And therefore, to the two marks of the Church, ordinarly aſſign'd by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, the Presbyterians ioyn'd their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline as the third: whereby they declared, that all Proteſtant Churches, which wanted this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, were not true, or at leaſt pure Churches of Chriſt. So that, they made their Presbyterian diſcipline, a ſubſtantial point of doctrine; the contrary whereof was taught, believed, and practiſed in the Bishops time in the Iſle of Britaine, and in all places, where the Lutheran Proteſtants lives. And what ever was the practiſe of the French Calviniſts, yet they did not definitiu'ly declare the office of Bishop
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43743:14"/> to be Antichriſtian; but kept ſociety with theſe Proteſtant Churches, where Epiſcopal gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement was eſtablished, and wrote moſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectiv'ly vnto the Bishops themſelves: as may be ſeen in the Survey of the new diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Secondly. After the change and abolition of the old governement of the Church: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded next to abolish all ſett prayers, all the orders and directions, which were ordain'd by I Knox, the firſt Fundatour or Reformer of this Church, for adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and of Mariage: yea all ſett formes of prayer were diſallowed, and cancelled, vpon pretext that they nourished tepidity, and ſmoothered the fervour of the Spirit, according to which, all perſons were ordain'd to pray; albeit often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes it prov'd the Spirit of giddineſſe: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd by their frequent Tautologies and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings. But it had not been ſo much matter for abrogating M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Knox his prayers, if they had not been too bold with the moſt excellent of all prayers, made by our B. Saviour himſelf, and recommended by him to all Chriſtians. For although the Miniſters were accuſtomed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to end their imperfect prayers, as they ſpoke, in that moſt perfect forme of prayer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de by Chriſt, which was alſo the practiſe of their firſt Reformers,<note place="margin">Knox chron. p. <hi>288.</hi>
                  </note> as may be ſeen in Knox Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, at the concluſion of the prayer for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction to the Superintendent: yet it was left off any more to be ſaid by theſe new Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Reformers: &amp; the reſt of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren thought it moſt ſecure for their own
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43743:15"/> own ſtanding to follow their Leaders. Albeit they cashiered all other ſett prayers, yet they might have excepted this, both for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenty of it, and the dignity of the Authour. They indeed ſpoke nothing publickely and directly againſt it; till one of their prime Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les did not ſtick to call the frequent vſe of it, moſt irreverently, a Papiſtical charme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they changed not only the prayers, but alſo the manner of ſinging pſalmes; for they tooke away and abolished the hymne of Glory to the Father and to the Son &amp;c. with which the Pſalme was ordinarly concluded, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome, which was kept from the beginning of the Reformation. This was not done by any formal act but (as a Miniſter ſpoke) by a deſuetude of the principal Covenanters, whoſe example the reſt of the Miniſters follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. But there was one thing which hapned in this matter not vnworthy of remark, and is very famous throughout the countrey: For whilſt the people of a Parish, in Anguſe, were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at the concluſion of a pſalme, <hi>Glory to the Father and to the Son &amp;c.</hi> as not knowing of the new alterations; they were preſently interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Miniſter, who cry'd aloud <hi>No more Glory to the Father, No more Glory</hi> &amp;c. which accident rendred the Presbyterians very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to the old Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they proceeded further, and ſtrook at the roote of the Chriſtian faith, to witt the Apoſtles Creed, denying it to be Apoſtolicall: The contrairy whereof we was taught in our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43743:15"/> yonger yeares, as was believed troughout the whole Chriſtian world. And after they had thus denyed the letter, and authority of it, they proceeded next to corrupt the ſenſe of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>He deſcended into hell,</hi> as we shall ſee shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly. Their inconſtancy and changes may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, in diverſe other points and practiſes, as in their taking the Communion ſitting, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning kneeling as vnlawfull. Their deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the bread among themſelues, wherein they place no ſmall purity of their religion, and not taking it out of the Miniſters hand, as the cuſtome was before. Their condemning pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion and private Baptiſme, although adminiſtrated vpon extream neceſſity; which I found to be pernicious errours, eſpecially in ſo far, as concern's Baptiſme. Their condemning as ſuperſtitious, the religious obſervation of Chriſtmaſſe, and of all other feſtival dayes &amp;c. All which are not only contrary to the doctrine of the moſt famous Proteſtant Churches abroad, but alſo were contrary to the doctrine, lawes &amp; practiſes of this Church at home. By which inconſtancy of the Miniſters, and the alterations made by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the people was not only miſerably toſſed to and fro, and carried about with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent winds of new doctrines: but alſo they knew not what to believe, and almoſt loos'd all belief, ſince they ſaw, that many points, which they believ'd before, being taught them by their own Paſtours, were now condemned by the ſame Paſtours, who are very like vnto theſe whom the Apoſtle S. Iude calls <hi>wandering ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43743:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Hauing thought ſeriouſly vpon theſe things, I made this reflection with my ſelf. How can this Scottish Church, which changeth like the Moone, and is as vnſtedfaſt as the wind; be the true Church of Chriſt which muſt be firme and ſtedfaſt as a rocke? How can theſe Miniſters, who drawes, yea driwes the people into ſuch varieties of faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.14.</note> be the true Apoſtles of Chriſt; ſeing they were eſtablished (as S. Paul teſtifies) to conſerve the people into the Vnity of Faith? They muſt be falſe Paſtours, who do toſſe the people to and fro with the inconſtant winds of their new doctrines: ſince true Paſtours were ordain'd by Chriſt to keep the people into the conſtant profeſſion of the old doctrin, which was once delivered, and generally profeſſed throughout the world, and to preſerve them from ſuch toſſings. As the ſcripture sheweth that inconſtancy and lightneſſe, belongs to falſe Teachers; ſo I found that the holy Fathers did obſerve it by experience.<note place="margin">Iren. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> S. Ireneus ſaith: <hi>They delight to find out, every day ſome new thing. Let vs now ſee their inconſtant doctrin. &amp;c.</hi> But 5. Hiero. moſt pithily deſcribs their humour. <hi>The feet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of thoſe who erre,</hi>

               <p>AS the Inconſtancy of a Church in faith and doctrine, gives iuſt occaſion to many, of doubting and ſtumbling at it's religion; ſo Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions and Diviſions, which neceſſarly flow from ſuch Inconſtancy, are no leſſe, but rather more ſenſible evils, and gives greater and more vniuerſal ſcandals. For there are many, who would take no notice of Inconſtancy; and yet are awakned by the confuſion, that ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Diſſenſion and Diviſion.</p>
               <p>It's evident by the light of reaſon, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becomes more the houſe of God, then vnity and order: and that confuſion and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are only fitting for Babel, or the houſe of the Devil: and as Vnity tends to preſervation, ſo Diſſenſion haſtens to deſtruction. Therefore our B. Saviour being to found his Church, which was to be a heavenly houſe vpon earth, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable order, and to ſtand for ever; did pray moſt earneſtly for the Vnity of it,<note place="margin">S. Thn ch. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> by which he knew it would be both beautifyed and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Yea, he sheweth, that by the admirable Vnity of his Church; the world showld know,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. ver.</hi> 21.23.</note> that he was ſent from heaven, and be made to believe in him. Therefore theſe Churches, which haue no Vnity, but are torne by Diſſenſions and Diviſions: cannot be the true Church of Chriſt, neither can they long laſte. As Vnity doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43743:17"/> beautifie, and conſerve the true Church; ſo Diſſenſion points out, deformes, and ever at lenth deſtroies all falſe Churches. Our Saviour ſaith;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Every kingdome divided againſt it ſelf, shall be made deſolate.</hi> And S. Paul: <hi>If yow bite and eate one an other; take heede you be not conſumed one of an other.</hi> And that this diviſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction befalls to all falſe Churches: Luther himſelf doth teſtifie. <hi>A kingdome,</hi> ſaith he <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it ſelf,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>cannot ſtand: neither did Heretiques at any tyme perish by force or art, but by their owne mutuall diſſenſions: neither doth Chriſt our Lord fight againſt them by other armes, then by ſending among them the Spirit of giddineſſe and diſſenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, what miſerable diſſenſions have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened theſe yeares by paſt, into the Church of Scotland, by which it hath been much defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and a conſiderable part of it deſtroyed; are knowen far and neare, at home and abroad. For theſe diſſentious haue been, for matter, manner, and the miſerable effects that have flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed from them, very remarkable. The matter of them concern'd no leſſe points, then the Governement of the Church eſtablished by Chriſt, the authority of the Apoſtles Creed, the vſe of the Sacraments, of private Baptiſme and Communion, the vſe of our Lords prayer, and of Glory to the Father, the keeping of holy dayes, and the reſt of the articles of Perth, the Covenant it ſelf, the Heade spring of all Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the authority of the Civil Magiſtrate &amp;c. But the forme and manner of theſe diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43743:17"/> hath overcome the matter: for it hath been ſo great, and confus'd, that it turned the eyes of all the world, to looke vpon that ſtrange and bloody Theater, which was thereby erected in great Britaine, and to take ſpecial notice of the diverſe repreſentations made vpon it. All hath been done on each ſide, that ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues and hands could do, to defame and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy one an other. Three famous Kingdomes have been thereby miſerably embroyl'd, in shedding their owne blood, and brought to horrible confuſion. And beſids the alterations, that have happened in the State: theſe Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions haue made great deſolation and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Church. For the Presbyterians, by their ſtrong aſſaults, have deſtroyed the late English Epiſcopal Church, which was eſteem'd ſo glorious: and the Independents againe, who ſprung vp from the Presbyterians, have by their ſtrong oppoſitions to Presbytery,<note place="margin">Chriſt, Mod. pag. <hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> much weakned it, and taken the power of ſtinging from that <hi>ſnake,</hi> as the Chriſtian Moderatour calls it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Presbyterians, ſo ſoone as they had perfected their work of deſtroying the Church of the old Proteſtants: fell preſently into Diſſenſions among themſelves, which were atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by Diviſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whereby they are now cut into ſmall pieces. The firſt Diſſenſion appeared, when ſome of the moſt able Miniſters among them, oppoſed the vnexpected reformation; that is, the abolishing of the hymne of <hi>Glory to the Father,</hi> and takeing away the vſe of our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43743:18"/> Lords prayer, and ſuch other innovations: for which oppoſition, covered with other pretexts, theſe Miniſters were depoſed. Then, in the laſt Nationall Aſſembly, at S. Andrew's, in the yeare 1651. there appear'd a new ſect, which, of Presbyterian Proteſtants, became Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Proteſtatours; proteſting againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that aſſembly. This Proteſtation hath made great diviſion amongſt them; ſo, that the two factions will hardly ſit together in Synods; but keeps their conventions a part. Diverſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter invectiues have paſt ſince that time, betwixt theſe two parties: but the Civil power is ſo ſtrong, and provident, that it keeps them from biting one another. Now lately againe, new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions have riſen. For ſome of the chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatours, have abandonned altogether Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byt'ry and Covenant, as humane inventions (although before, they preached and cryed them vp, as divine and cleare truths) and have rendered themſelves Independents. And ſome of theſe, after a little pauſe in Independency, that they may attayne yet to a greater purity, which they imagin doth conſiſt in going further from Popery, are become Anabaptiſts.</p>
               <p>But among all theſe Changelings, there are two Miniſters in the North moſt famous; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one of them was eſteemed very learned, and both of them were very zealous Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Presbyterians, who by word and work, violently forced others to be like to themſelves. They commonly ſtyl'd the Independents, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Sectarians, periur'd perſons, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43743:18"/> Any word ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Presbytery, was called by them hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemy. And yet, shortly after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents became Maiſters, they begun to extoll highly a new light, that had appeared vnto them; and on a ſuddaine they quitted both Covenant and Presbytery, as humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and became Independents. This change ſo vnexpected, was the cauſe of much admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to many, and of many obſervations; but this, which I heard a friend make, before ſome company, ſeem'd to me moſt remarkable. Either (ſaid he) theſe Miniſters were ignorant, before their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, of the falshood, which they now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in the Covenant and Presbytery; or they were not ignorant, but knew the falshood of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If they where ignorant: Then they were ſcarcely worthy to be Miniſters, much leſſe to be eſteemed of ſo great learning, as one of them was reputed heretofore, and both are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be, by their new preferments to the higheſt places of dignity and learning, that can be had in a Colledge or an Vniverſity. Were theſe men Maiſters in Iſrael, and yet vere igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of a queſtion, that had been ſo long in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for which there had been ſo much trouble and bloodshed? Did they not know ſo much; as what Governement Chriſt had eſtablished in his Church? If they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the falshood, which they now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be in the Covenant and Presbytery: Then in the time of their ignorance, they could have no cleare and certaine knowledge of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43743:19"/> truth of them How then could they be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as to preach and cry vp theſe shings as divin truths, and cleare engyring lights? Yea how could they be ſo vn-Chriſtianly cruel, as to perſecute and force others, making them ſwear theſe things to be divin truths, whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had no certaine knowledge, and which now they condemne as groſſe falshoods, and humane inventions.<note place="margin">

If it be ſaid that they were not ignorant: but knew well enough the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood of the Presbyterian Covenanting way, which they followed, and yeelded to the times, for ſome wordly reſpects: Then they fall into a worſe inconveniency, then before. For by, that means, they would be guilty of moſt deepe and damnable hypocriſy; ſince they had not only profeſſed and practized ſuch things, as were directly againſt their owne conſcience, but alſo fotced many others to doe the ſame, with oathes againſt their conſciences. Thus he. For my part, I do not know, how to free theſe Miniſters, of one of theſe imputations. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinks it probable, that this new light would never have clear'd the eyes of their minds; if the light of ſome temporall intereſt had not firſt illuminated the eyes of their bodies.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this ſeparation, there aroſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous diſſenſions, betwixt an old Apoſtle of the Covenant, and one of theſe new Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43743:19"/> who had agreed before like Simeon and Levi to do hurt. For neare the ſpace of a yeare, their ſermons, preached in the ſame Church, were nothing, but continual contradictions, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſcoffings at one another. What was ſaid by the one in thefore noone, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trould out of the ſame pulpit, by the other in the after-noone. The Presbyterian did bend all his wits to prove, that Presbytery was <hi>iure diuino.</hi> And the new convert, would neither have it, to be good nor expedient <hi>iure humano.</hi> Yea ſometymes they would chooſe the ſame text, and in the ſame Church, before the ſame Auditory; they would with contentious zeal deduce contradictory concluſions, As out of this text:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Holyneſſe beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thy houſe, O Lord,</hi> the new Independent did amply inferre, that none ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged members of the Church, except thoſe, who were viſible ſaints, And from the ſame text the old Presbyterian, did ſtrive to shew, that, in the Church, there was both chaffe and wheate, the evill mixed with the good. Some of the people tooke great ſcandall, and others, eſpecially the old Epiſcopal Proteſtants, made good ſport of theſe diſſenſions. And although, by interceſſion of ſome friends, an agreement was made at laſt, betwixt theſe two Miniſters, to make them abſtaine from their publique, and ſcandalous contradictions; yet, that concord did not laſte long, their inward fire did shortly burſt forth. For one day, after Sermon, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent inviting the people to his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. which he was to give the next Sunday:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43743:20"/> he was publickly interrupted by the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who accuſed him of Apoſtaſy from the Covenant and Presbytery, and ſtraitly charged the people to receive no Communion from him: And with this confuſion the meeting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but the Miniſters bauling continued a ſpace thereafter. The event did shew, that the Presbyterian got the better of this conflict: for the other did not appeare at the day appoynted, to give the Communion, as he had promiſed. Yet, the fulneſſe of the Presbyterians victory was much diminished, by reaſon, the others place was ſupplyed by his Colleague, who beſids others, had both the Presbyterians daughter and ſon-in-law for two of his Communicants.</p>
               <p>I conceived, that all theſe diſſenſions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions did fall forth by Divin providence, to give people ſufficient notice, that a Church of ſo great confuſion, cannot be the true Church of Chriſt, which ought to be a houſe of great order and Vnity, and to shew, that theſe Miniſters, who are the Rulers, or rather M ſ-rulers of ſuch a confus'd Church, and who bragge ſo much of the Spirit, are not led by the Spirit of God, which is not contrary to himſef<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the Spirit of errour and giddineſſe. And although ſometymes, the Miniſters, to cover the vgly deformity and great ſcandals of all their diſſenſions, would pretend, that their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences were not in fundamentall points; yet at other times their words did varie, and their actions contradicted ever their words. For they changed their tongue, as the diverſity of queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43743:20"/> did trouble them; or the intereſt of their cauſe did preſſe them. When they were not vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with their diſſenſions; then, they cry'd vp Presbytery as the only ſcepter of Chriſt, the only governement of the Church <hi>iure divino,</hi> the only means to vphold Chriſts Kingdome, and to hold out the wild boare of Anti-Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. It's well knowen alſo, how neceſſary and fundamentall a point the Covenant was eſteem'd; and how the Miniſters put it, very neare, in ballance with the booke of life. But their actions did shew more ſenſibly, then their words, that they eſteem'd their diſſenſions to be in ſubſtantiall and fundamentall matters. Or elſe they have been voyde, not only of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity, but alſo of humane diſcretion. For how could they haue embroyl'd all theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, into ſo great confuſion and bloodshed; for ſuch matters, as themſelves eſteem'd only circumſtantiall and not ſubſtantiall? How could they with any diſcretion, force theſe points of their now Reformation, which they thought only ceremoniall, and not ſubſtantiall, ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſubſtantially vpon others?</p>
               <p>But whither their differences were in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals or not, for the <hi>Matter:</hi> It's euident, that they were ſubſtantiall and fundamentall for the <hi>manner,</hi> to the ſubſtantiall deſtruction of one and other, and almoſt to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſubverſion of three kinhdomes. Yea I found, that the Preſbyterians in Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and King Iames time were more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, and confeſſed freely, that their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43743:21"/> from the English Church, were in weighty and ſubſtantiall matters. For thus they ſpeake in M. Rogers.<note place="margin">M. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. Doct. Aug. num. <hi>

And in all theſe, they have Tragicall differences: beſids, in many other points, no leſſe ſubſtantiall, although not ſo

Whither Chriſt redeem'd the world by shedding his blood and corporall death, or by ſuffering in his ſoule the paines of Hell? Whither man, after the fall, hath free will? and many more which may be ſeen collected in the Proteſtants Apology:<note place="margin">Apol.

               <p>Having then diligently conſidered theſe things, I made this reflection with my ſelf. How can this Scottish Church, which is like a Babel of confuſion, be the true Church of Chriſt, which, for order and Vnity, ought to be like to the heauenly Ieruſalem? How can that Church, which is the vnhappy roote of ſo much Diſſenſion and Diviſion, be the Church of Chriſt, which is no leſſe the roote of Vnity, then it is the pillar and ground of verity? I ſee, that ever one ſect begets an other, which not only divids, but ſtrives alſo like vipers brood to deſtroy the former. Such confuſion and Diſſenſion becomes not the Church of Chriſt, but are more proper for the Synagogue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chriſt. If the true Church may be knowen by her Vnity; then the falſe Church is no leſſe but more eaſily diſcerned by its Diſſenſion.<note place="margin">

They complain'd much of hard vſage vnder the Bishops, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43743:22"/> cry'd for compaſſion of tender conſciences: And who would haue expected hard vſage from ſuch men? Or, that they would have ſtrain'd other mens conſciences, who would not ſuffer their own to be touch'd? If they ould not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto ſome degree of Chriſtian perfection, in meekneſſe &amp; mercy: they might at leaſt have practiſed a moral vertue; Not to do that vnto others, which they would not wish to be done to themſelv's.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the Covenant, in the yeare 1638. the Presbyterians appear'd firſt like lambs: for they vſed nothing but milde invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and many plauſible words, to induce men to renew (as they ſpoke) the National Covenant with God, the breach of which was the cauſe of all miſeries, and the keeping of it would be the ſource of all happineſſe. This was the only means to divert Gods imminent iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to conſerve purity, and hold away Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. And according to this milde tenour, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners and Miniſters were ſent to all parts of the Countrey, to draw the hearts and hands of all men to the Covenant. All this time, they profeſs'd, that they would vrge, or force no man, againſt his conſcience: but shortly after, they had by theſe faire mean's, got their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and power encreas'd; they chang'd their tunes, they left off entreaties, and procceded to threatnings; and from theſe, they went to their Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, to deprivation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Excommunications, to plundering and ſacking of mens houſes, ſequeſtrating their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43743:23"/> eſtates, impriſoning their perſon's, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting all the old Proteſtants, whoſe conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ty'd them to live conforme, to the law's of Church and ſtate, not as yet abrogated. The Presbyterian Miniſters tongues, were sharped like two edged ſwords, cutting in pieces all mens honour, reputation and honeſty, who diſſented from them, although never ſo inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively: And they never ceaſed by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall clamours, to whet the material ſword againſt them. So that, albeit they begun with Iacobs voice; yet they ended with Eſaus handes: They appear'd firſt like lambs; but their rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nature did ſoone shew, that they were only covered with lambſ-skinnes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their ſpiritual Tyranny, over mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, was very great: for they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Obedience to their doctrin and new orders, which, almoſt all Proteſtants would have given: retaining only an internall liberty, according to the light of their minds, not to condemne the former governement, doctrines &amp; practiſes, as in themſelv's vnlawful &amp; againſt Gods word. But the Presbyterians requyred all men to ſweare, that they thought &amp; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, Presbyterian doctrin and diſciplin, to be only lawfull, according to Gods word, and the contrary, of Epiſcopacy; and the other points which they had condemned to be falſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious, which was to force men to ſin, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them not only do, but alſo ſweare things, that were directly againſt the light of their conſciences; which is the higheſt degree of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43743:23"/> of ſoule Tyranny. Yea, the Presbyterians rigour and cruelty, was not only great, but alſo Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal: for none, of whatſoeuer condition or quality, could be free of it. Although at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, men were only admitted to ſubſcribe the Covenant; yet shortly thereafter, the more zealous ſiſters obtain'd that fauour, and others, who were not ſeeking that curteſie, got it preſs'd vpon them. At lenth it came to children at ſchoole, to ſeruants, young maides, and all ſort's of perſons, without exception. And theſe, who could not write their owne names into the Covenant, behoved to do it by a publick Notary: ſo, that they would haue none to be left out of Gods Covenant, and the Covenant of grace, as they ſpoke. The Miniſters, who did not conforme themſelv's to theſe new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were preſently render'd odious by the name of Papiſts, and, by populare tumults rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s'd againſt them, were forced to leave the Countrey. And many others, who ſwore all that the Presbyterians could require; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not ſeem to be zealous enough in the cauſe, were depoſed; and they, with their wives aad children, expoſed without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, to great want and miſery. Then for the lay Proteſtants: theſe among them, who could not be drawen on, by the Miniſters faire words, threatnings nor cenſures, were driven to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by Miniſterial Armies; which conſiſted, principally, at the beginning, of Highlanders, whom the old Proteſtants call'd Argyle Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; who by their ſakeing and burning of ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43743:24"/> good houſes, converted more to the Covenant, then the Miniſters had done. For diverſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality were impriſoned and fyned, till affliction gave them vnderſtanding, and made their wills plyable to accept and ſweare the new Reformation: whoſe example many others followed.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Presbyterians preſs'd all Noblemen and Barons, to receive into their houſes, Chaplaines of their chooſing or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; to ſay vnto them extemporary prayers. But one of their employments, and that not the leaſt, was to obſerve, what they heard or ſaw, ſpoken or done, againſt Presbyt'ry, and the bliſſed work of reformation (as they call'd it) and to make a true relation of all their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, to the Presbyt'ry; vpon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their preferment to a Church. And, when any of theſe Chaplains ſeem'd not to be faithfull enough, in giving theſe relations; the Presbyt'ry would ſometimes ſummon other ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vants, to depoſe vpon oath, what they knew ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or done, in the family againſt Presbyt'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: which, being rightly conſidered, was no ſmall trouble to theſe perſons, who could nor be free of Presbyterian Tyranny, within their owne private families; in many whereof, the Presbyterians would have rais'd vp more then one Iudas.</p>
               <p>The rigour and Tyranny of Presbyterians, was not only ſpiritual over mens Conſciences; but it was alſo Temporal over mens Eſtates and perſons. For beſids the groſſes fines, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43743:24"/> they impoſed vpon thoſe, who could not get implicit faith ſoone enough, to heare &amp; beleeve them; they made a general miſery to overflow the whole Countrey, by their new inventions, to maintaine and advance their plots and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gn's: as by their Leavie money, Lone money, Monthly maintenance, Blind bonds, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe others. Their Souldiours (who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly ſtyled Saints,) were very vnruly, and inſatiably avaritious; ſo that they proved ſore Saints to many, whereof the North of England had ſome experience. Then the Presbyterians ſeverity over all their Oppoſers became ſo well knowen; that none expected favour, who fell into there hands. The Miniſters cry'd alway's for iuſtice, to divert from the land, (as they gave out) Gods iudgements. It would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to relate all the particulars, that have paſt of their ſeverity. That alone, which they vs'd againſt the Lord <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and his fellow Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, made their temper ſufficiently knowen to all Europe. For although they coul'd not have been much blam'd, ſuppoſing their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for removing out of the way, ſuch an active enemy; yet, the manner of it shew too great paſſion and cruelty. Some reſpect might have been had to his ancient Nobility, to his perſonall Gallantry, and many worthy parts: but eſpecially to his admirable Clemency sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w'd to his Enemies after many notable victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries obtayn'd over them. But notwithſtanding all theſe reſpects, when he fell into the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians hands: they were not content to put
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43743:25"/> him ſymply to death, vnleſſe they ſatisfyed their paſſion by putting diſgraces vpon him. For they brought him vp the high ſtreet of Edim: borough, bound with ropes to a chaire in a Carte, bareheaded, the common Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner riding in livery, covered before him: which ſpectacle was ſo cruel and lamentable, that it wreſted teares from many of his Enemies. This was the Triumphal Entrie, he got into that cittie, which was in his power, after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of Kilſyth, to have burn't and ſack'd, but of his innate clemency did ſpare it. And within two or three dayes, after this ſolemne entrie, they cauſed him, not only to be hang'd; but alſo to be diſmembred and quartered; ordaining his Head, Legges, and Armes to be affix't in the principal Townes of the Countrey, and the trunck of his body to be buryed vnder the common gallowes. And all this was done, by expreſſe order of the Presbyterians, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all other, from having voices in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That ſcaffold, which was erected, at the croſſe of Edimborough, for the execution of Montroſe, did remaine vnremoved, about the ſpace of two months, conrrarie to all former cuſtome: vpon which, every week, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians offered vp diverſe ſacrifices of gallant and worthy men: ſo, that it became a heape of blood; and therefore it was called by many of the people, <hi>The Miniſters Altar:</hi> who [as they alleadged] delights not in vnbloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Yea, ſome of the, Miniſters hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Montroſe was ſo great, that it did not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43743:25"/> end with his death; but purſued his memory after death; calling him publickly, a periur'd Traytor, a Dogge, the Malignants God, with many ſuch vncivil epithets. Then they bragged: who durſt any more oppoſe them, or ſet their faces againſt them? That God had now own'd their cauſe, and had brought their greateſt Enemy's to confuſion; as they had often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy'd, for which, ever thereafter, they ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to be beleev'd. But all the ſeverity and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, that had paſt, was nothing to that, which many wiſe men foreſaw was approaching; if the reigne of Presbyt'ry had endured longer. Before Montroſe death, the Presbyterians were not free of feares, and were not fully Maſters: but shortly after getting home the King, whom they made to ſubſcryb and ſwear their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and ſolemne League, and to confirme all their proceedings; they had higher deſign's. But, as the Chriſtian Moderatour hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, their fall was nearer then they expected; and <hi>the hand of God ſtop't them in their full car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere:</hi> So, that they were not only rendered vnable to do more hurt, which they intended; but alſo, they were happily hind'red from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more that, which they practiſed, at leaſt in their accuſtomed rigour.</p>
               <p>Theſe obvious conſiderations made the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſeverity of Presbyt'ry, appeare to be very Tyrannous vnto me. For thereby I ſaw; that it was both Spiritual and Temporal, and extended to the Soules and Bodies, lives and Eſtates, yea, and to the very Memories of men,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43743:26"/> after their death; and that for pretext of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to Proteſtants, whom ſometimes they acknowledge to be of their owne religion. And therefore I made this reflection with my ſelf. How can this Presbyterian Church have Chriſtian truth and purity, ſince it's ſo voyd of Chriſtian meekneſſe &amp; mercy? How can theſe Presbyterian Miniſters be Chriſts true Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29.</note> ſince they do not learne nor practiſe his leſſons? Chriſt ſaith: <hi>learne of me for I am meek and humble of heart.</hi> They learne this leſſon backward: for they shew no Meekneſſe nor Humility, but rather the contrary, all Pride and cruelty. Our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Love your enemies.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 5.44.</note> The Presbyterians hates and perſecut's their friends, their owne Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Proteſtants. Truly, I cannot think there can be much truth among Presbyterians, where there is ſo little mercy. They would have done well, to have ioyn'd theſe two together, &amp; vſed Salomons wiſe adviſe; <hi>Let not mercy and truth leave thee;</hi> and then perhaps they had found more credit.</p>

               <p>TRVTH is alway's conſonant to it ſelf. Wiſe men do not fall into manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; and good men do not practiſe theſe things, which they blame and condemne in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43743:26"/> others. Now, in many things, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians appear'd to me, to contradict their owne principles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth in deeds and words; whereby they bewray'd the vanity of their faire pretexts; and shew, that ſome of their Principles were ſo falſe, that themſelv's were forced, to goe often againſt them and controwle them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This appeared in their pretext of tender Conſciences, which truly I, and many others, beleeved they, for the moſt part, had: till they tooke the power of ruling, or rather do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering over other mens Conſciences. But, as it is in the proverbe, <hi>Magiſtratus indicat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> Many ſeeme good, ſo long as they have no power to do evil. The Presbyterians tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of conſcience was moſt eſteem'd, when it was leaſt knowen: but, ſo ſoone as it was brought to the light, it loſt more credit, then they acquyred power. When the prime Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleaders of this mad Presbyterian Dance, were vrged to conformity in the Bishops time. O then they cry'd vp their tender Conſciences! They could not ſo much as cary a Caſſocke, nor make a Sermon on Chriſtmaſſe, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts Nativity, nor Baptize a child privat'ly, although at the point of death; Their tender Conſciences could not digeſt ſuch hard meates: they would ſtand to the purity of their Reformation, which had abandonned all ſuch Superſtitions. But after they became Maſters, they ſeem'd to ſwallow downe ſome more groſſe morſels; and, for all the pretended puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their firſt Reformation, they would yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43743:27"/> Reforme and purify it more. For then they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted: the denying of the Apoſtles Creed, the abrogating the hymne of Glory to the Father, the forbearing of ſaying our Lords prayer (all which were practiſed by their firſt Reformers) beſids the many terrible oaths of the Covenant, and their obedience ſworne to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical: all which and many more they ſwallowed downe, without the leaſt trouble of their Conſciences. Now, how can ſuch men be iuſtly thought to have tender Conſciences, who ſtarted ſo at ſtraw's, and leap't over Mountains? who are like thoſe, of whom our Saviour ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 23.24.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſtraine a gnat and ſwallow a Camel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As they pretended much tenderneſſe of Conſcience, in time of their Subiection; ſo they cry'd then much for Compaſſion, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt they all found. For it cannot be denyed, that the Scottish Bishops vſed no great ſeverity againſt them: but gave, to thoſe who were in poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Churches, and to all Laiques wharſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, full power of enioying both internal &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall inoffenſive liberty of their Conſciences. But ſo ſoone, as the Presbyterians had vnhorſed the Bishops, and got vpon their Saddle; they rul'd the raines, and vs'd their Spurres in a more Cavalier-like manner. Let men cry never ſo much Mercy and Compaſſion: the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would shew none. Neither would ſimple Obedience content them: Oaths were alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, not only to make men obey, but to ſwear themſelv's out of their Conſciences. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43743:27"/> the Presbyterians thought, no others, beſids themſelvs, had Conſcience; which is no ſmal ſigne, that they had not much: but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had, or had not; it was evident, they had no compaſſion. The old Proteſtants were long vnder the Presbyterian rod: and it was preparing alſo for the Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and other new ſorts of Proteſtants, who are permitted to ſerve God in their owne Goſpel way. The rod had ſome mercy, for it happily broke in the Presbyterians hand, which had none. In this, the Presbyterians caried themſelves very irrationally, that in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, they would have, and found alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from others: but, in their Exaltation, they would shew no Compaſſion to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They inveighed moſt sharply againſt the Bishops, for medling in Civil and State affaires, as vnbeſeeming Eccleſiaſtical perſons: and yet the Presbyterian Miniſters did meddle much more in them, then ever the Bishops had done: but with this difference; that, the Bishops, as Lords of Councel and Parliament, had the freedom of their voices with the reſt, but could not carrie any buſineſſe; vnleſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Temporal Eſtate did concurre with them: neither could they hinder any affaire, which the moſt voices caried. The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Miniſters, did not indeed ſit in Councel or Parliament; but they ſat in another Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which made it ſelf Superiour to both, and drew all weighty affaires to it's cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance For although the Councel or Parliament
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43743:28"/> concluded any thing in ſtate affaires; it was not to be obeyed, vnleſſe the Presbyterian Commiſſion of the Church had given conſent, without danger of their thundering cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: as was evident in the matter of the Inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, after the bad ſucceſſe whereof, they entered into peaceable poſſeſſion of Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both over Covncel and Parliament. For all things were ſent to the Commiſſion of the Church, with ſubmiſſion to their Approbation or Reprobation. By them, the Malignants were purged out of the Army of the Saints: and, when that Army had bad ſucceſſe at Dumbar, they were againe by them admitted. which bred a great rent among the Miniſters, for being ſo inconſtant in their principles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They accuſed the Bishops of Tyranny, and domineering over the Lords Inheritance; and yet themſelves became more guilty of theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as may appeare to any man, who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare together their deportments. Yea ſuch a huge difference will be ſeen, that the Bishops fault, in regard of theirs, will appear but like a Mote to a Mountaine. The Bishops, in the ſpace of 40. yeares, ſcarcely depoſed foure Miniſters; and that, not for following inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively the liberty of their Conſciences: but for their inordinate zeal and bitter invectives. The Presbyterians, in leſſe then the fourth part of that time, have depoſed ſome hundreds, many of which had never ſpoken againſt them. Then, the Bishops troubled no Laicks, carying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peaceably; neither did they impoſe any
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43743:28"/> oaths vpon them: but the Presbyterians trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all conditions and qualities, in a moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourous manner, with fearfull oaths; which to many, as being againſt their Conſciences, were flat periuries.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we reflect a little vpon Pride, which the Presbyterians did ſo much condemn in the Bishops: and iudge by the effects, ſince God alone knowes the hearts: the Presbyterians ſeem's to have out ſtrip't the Prelats, both in words and Actions. For it hath appeared, as an inſeparable property, in the Miniſters of the Presbytery, eſpecially of the righteſt ſtamp, and deepeſt graine; to make their owne will, not only a rule for themſeves; but alſo a law to others, and that without Controll: which is the higheſt point of pride. Their proud contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning words, vttered publlckly agrinſt perſons of greateſt quality, are well enough-knowen: becauſe they are yet fresh in mens memories. Their proud cariage, may be knowen by this alone, that they made the greateſt Noblemen of the Kingdome, not only do publick pennance in Sackcloth, before the people, in the Church, for their oppoſing the orders of Presbytery: but alſo they behooved to Petition in that hairie-gowne, five or ſix Miniſters ſitting in the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and ſo often as they were called, ſo often they were to appeare, before that high Iudicatory, in their Penitential habit. And thus after a great deal of ceremony (as if it had been a great curteſie) they would at lenth be admitted, to take the Covenant, and with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43743:29"/> moſt terrible oaths, and holding vp of hands, permitted to ſwear obedience vnto the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery. And although, all this odedience, was knowen to many, and to the Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be more external then internal, more for worldly then ſpiritual ends, to be free of the Presbytery's vexations; yet the Miniſters ſtood not ſo much for the heart: they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, if this external adoration was giuen by men of greateſt quality, vnto their Soveraigne Tribunal. For then they bragged, that none thereafter durſt ſtand out any more againſt them. The Cedars were made to bow: and the Shrubs might be affray'd to be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. An Officer of the English Army obſerved ſome traces of this pride, to be yet remaining, even in the Presbyteries ſubiection. For, in a letter dated from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in Februarie 1651. and cited in the Chriſtian Moderatour, he writ's thus to a friend.<note place="margin">Chriſt. Moder. p. <hi>74.</hi> &amp; <hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Yow would wonder to obſerve the ſtrange Pride and proceedings of the kirk-Clergy &amp;c.</hi> And in an other letter dated in April. 1652. he makes this obſervation. <hi>Beleeve it, all our other Enemies are tame heaſts to the high Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and yet with the winding and turning of a religious pretence, and an artificial zeal againſt hereſie, he will like a tame ſnake (if not warily avoyded) get into your boſome</hi> If this ingenious Officer obſerv'd ſo much, when he ſaw Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byt'ry in its Declination; what would he have obſerv'd and ſaid, if he had ſeen it, in the hight of it's Elevation? I have knowen ſome Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Presbyterian Miniſters wish, that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43743:29"/> had not caried thinge, with ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of rigour, and ſo high a hand. For indeed it was not convenient, that theſe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Pride in others, should exerciſe much more themſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They profeſſe, that every particular Church is fallible, and ſo conſequently their owne; as their frequent changes, and manifeſt experience do shew. Therefore I iudged they did very inconſequentially, in exacting ſo rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly an vndeniable obedience, with oaths, to a fallible, and perhaps an actually erring Church: with which, yow muſt wheele about againe, when it wheels; and turn with it, as a Weather-Cocke, with the wind. Yow muſt ſwear, this yeare, that to be true, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, the next yeare, the ſame Exactours, vpon pretence of new lights, will have yow ſwear to be falſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They inveigh often againſt implicit faith, as Popish and Anti-Chriſtian: and yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues practiſe it, in a moſt groſſe manner, and very inconſequentially. That they practiſe it, is manifeſt. For, who among the people, hath expreſſe knowledge of all points of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and of their new Confeſſion? And yet, they are made to abiure all the points of the one, and to believe all the articles of the other. Yea, it's knowen by experience, that few of the Miniſters themſelves, know all the points abiured in the Covenant: as <hi>opus operatum, Stations</hi> and the like: and yet all are abiured. Therefore they practiſe in deeds, what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43743:30"/> in words; and they do the ſame thing, which they iudge and condemn in others. Yea, it is conſiderable, that they do not only goe againſt their principle: but alſo they abuſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith, in ſuch a groſſe and irrational man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as cannot be imputed vnto the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques. For theſe, beleeving explicity their Church to be infallible, and to be continually aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, conforme to this principle, do moſt rationally, to believe impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly all points, which the ſame Church tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and believes; iuſt as a Proteſtant, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving explicity the Scripture to be Gods word, although he doth not know expreſly all the ſentences and verſes in it, yet, with great reaſon, he believeth implicity all to be true and reveal'd by God, which is contayn'd in it. But, the Presbyterian Church being fallible, and profeſſing it ſelf to be ſo; requires very ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationally an implicit faith to all her doctrine, whereof a man can prudently believe no more; then he ſees and knowes. Moreover, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians haue fallen into a third more groſſe and inconſequentiall errour, concerning this implicit faith. Fore they haue forced many, not only to ſwear and ſubſcrive ſuch things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof they were ignorant; but alſo ſuch things, which the Presbyterians themſelves knew to be againſt the expreſſe knowledge, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the Swearers and Subſcrybers: which, is to force men to ſin: as is evident out of the 14. to the Romans. This is a rare kinde of implicit faith, which can conſiſt with explicit
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43743:30"/> beleef of the contrary. I heard from a perſon worthy of Credit, that, when this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience was propoſed to a prime Apoſtle of the Covenant; how many were driwen to periury, by ſwearing againſt their Conſciences; he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered. <hi>That it was all one to him, let them looke to it.</hi> And, vpon an other occaſion, he ſaid to a Roman Catholique, (who after great trouble, offered at lenth to take the Covenant) <hi>If thou be not ſincere, I shall make thee damn thy owne ſoule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. They appeared alſo vnto me, to goe clearly againſt an other Principle of theirs, to witt: That the Scripture is the only Iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. And yet the Presbytery did make it ſelf only Iudge. And after it pronounced ſentence, all were obliged, yea and forced to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, albeit many could not find their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Deciſions in the Scriptures. But I found, that the ſimple truth was; they gave the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the only name of a Iudge, and keep't all power of Iudging to themſelves: iuſt as they did with the King, to whom they gave a bare em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty title, but keep't to themſelves the reall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and exerciſe of all Royall power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they ſeem'd to overshoote themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves very much, when, not long before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of Dumbar, they made their ſolemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to God, for decyding the iuſtneſſe of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, by the victory, that was to enſue, whereof they thought themſelves very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as indeed they had great probability.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43743:31"/> The English Army, (notwithſtanding many diſavantages wherewith they were preſt) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the Appeale, and makes alſo their recour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to God, after the ſame manner. And at lenth, the queſtion being decyded in favour of the English; when the moſt Eminent perſon of that Army put the Miniſters in mind, of their Solemn Appeale, and how God had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſentence againſt them: he received this anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. <hi>You muſt not Iudge the goodneſſe of a cauſe by the event.</hi> Which words vere very inconſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to their Appeale: and in which abſurdity they had not fallen, if the victory had be fallen to them. Many Miniſters, ſince that time, have blam'd the rashneſſe of that Appeale; as being grounded more vpon humane confidence, then any Divin aſſurance.</p>
               <p>By theſe conſiderations, I diſcovered clearly, the vanity of the Presbyterians many faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; and how their deeds contradicted their words; how themſelves did the ſame things, which they condemned in others; and how their Principles were ſo falſe, that themſelves behooved to controull them. They pretended great tenderneſſe of Conſciences, when they were Servants, but shew ſtrong Conſciences, when they were Maſters. They cry'd much for compaſſion in their ſubiection: but would shew none in their Exaltation. They condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd the Bishops for medling in Civil affaires: and yet their Miniſters did rule the affaires of State. They accuſed others of pride and Tyranny: and yet their owne little fingers have been more
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43743:31"/> heavy, then the others loines: and they have shewed more pride and contempt of others, in one yeare, then theſe, whom they accuſe, had done, in forty. They profeſſe themſelves to be fallible in faith, and yet they will be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly believed, and vndeniably obeyed. They renounce implicit faith: and yet they practiſe it, and, in a moſt groſſe and vnreaſonable ſenſe, exacts it. They pretend the Scripture to be the only Iudge of Controverſies: and yet they will take all power of Iudging to themſelves. They will be eſteem'd true Prophets, when they gueſſe right: and they will not have themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves thought falſe Prophets, when they divin wrong. They would have their cauſe eſteem'd good for it's proſperity: and they will not have it thought evil when it fall's into adverſity. In a word, their doctrin's and practiſes were ſo full of contradictions, that I found many of them, not only to be humane, but alſo falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions: which may be showen in diverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars: but theſe for our intention are ſufficient, to shew that I could not prudently believe them, much leſſe could I hazard my Salvation vpon them.</p>

The very naming of a Presbyterian, is ſufficient now to raiſe in mens minds, the true notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one, who will obſtinatly deny obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to thoſe, to whom he oweth it; and will rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly exact obedience from thoſe, who owes him none. Indeed, if the Presbyterians owne words be taken, they will be eſteem'd not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saints, but alſo moſt loyall and obedient ſubiects; for ſo often they have tearm'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

Many other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be brought, of their inordinat cariage to their Superiours, and others, by which they rais'd both ſcandal and preiudice, againſt their religion: for people, ſeeing them to be evil Subiects, and worſe Maſters, could not think them to be good Chriſtians: but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, not being willing to rip vp too much their ſores, wishing rather, that all their bypaſt miſcariages may be forgot and buried, by their calme cariage and dutifull obedience, in time to come.

               <p>In a word: if piety conſiſts in many externall ſighes and grones, in long prayer and graces, in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43743:34"/> wringing of hands &amp; making of ſtrange faces, in turning of the eyes, and in dolefull houlings and cryes, which were commonly called the Sough; If piety, I ſay, conſiſts in ſuch things, we had abondance of it: but, if it require ſome greater perfections and better fruits: Then we were very ſcarce of it. Indeed, if we would heare and believe theſe Presbyterian Miniſters, we were the happieſt people of the world: for they ſaid, we only of all Nations had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be Covenanters with God; we had the truth of the Goſpell in greater purity then Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva it ſelf. We had ſuch a clear and engyring light, that the like had not shin'd to any other nation, ſince the time of the Apoſtles. Yea one, who is eſteem'd a principal Apoſtle among them, did not ſticke to affirme in the pulpit, amidſt the manyfold Confuſions, troubles and miſeries, which had fallen vpon this Church &amp; Nation: <hi>That the Angels and Saints of heaven, if they could leave the ſight of God, would be glad to come down, and ſee the admirable order and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this, to be much wonder'd at; for it's probable he ſpoke as he thought, and as the proverbe is. <hi>The Crow thinks ever her owne bird faireſt.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe practiſes, at leaſt a great part of them, were the occaſion of my firſt doubting that the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43743:34"/> Presbyterian Church, could not be the true Church of Chriſt. For by the Prebyterians changes and inconſtancy in doctrin, I ſaw evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently they were not govern'd by the Spirit of truth, which Chriſt promiſed to his Church; but by the Spirit of errour, whic is alwaies va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>By their great Diſſenſions and Diviſions, I perceived they had no vnity, as becometh the houſe of God: but were a confus'd Chaos, as many heads, ſo many different opinions; and that it was not truth nor authority, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd in their meetings; but the vſurpation of ſome few Ringleaders, who owerawed the reſt and made them ſuccumb. Yea, I ſaw that inconſtancy in doctrin flowes naturally from their principles: and that their inconſtant Church doth neceſſarly breed diſſenſions; but hath no means to lay them, nor take them away.</p>
               <p>By their cruell ſeverity over mens Conſcien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and perſons, &amp;c. I ſaw they had little Chriſtian Love and meekneſſe, which vertues Chriſt had recommended ſo earneſtly to his true diſciples, by which he ſaid the world should know them.</p>
               <p>By their clear contradicting their owne principles, I perceived, they were not men led by reaſon; but miſcaried by paſſion and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderat zeal, which made them fall into incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentiall diſcourſes, not worthy of men of prudence; and by which, themſelves shew the falshood of their owne principles.</p>
               <p>By doing their duty ſo ill to man; I ſaw evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43743:35"/> they perform'd not well their duty to God: by their violent diſobedience to their Earthly Superiours, I knew they could not be humbly obedient to their heavenly Soveraigne: By their great pretext of pietie, without any ſubſtance; and by their bragg's of the Spirit, without any fruites of the Spirit, but rather with the works of the flesh; I perceiv'd, they were both corrupt in faith and manners. And albeit, ſome of the more ſimple had great zeal, and no evill intentions; yet others of a higher or be, who moved the reſt, gave no ſmall ground to make many ſuſpect, that they were not ſincere Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Although, all that hath been already ſaid, (which are not old nor hidden ſtories, but ſuch things as were done in our owne times, and obvious to our ſenſes) did shew vnto me ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, the vnreaſonableneſſe of the new Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Reformation: yet, for my further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and leaſt I might be deceived, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try diligently and impartially, the grounds of theſe new changes and alterations; and to vſe the Apoſtle S. Iohns counſel to prove the Spirits. <hi>My deereſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>believe not every Spirit,</hi>

                  <hi>but prove the Spirits, if they be of God: for many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> Now the triall, which I intended, was to trie their doctrin, by the pure word of God, which theſe Reformers gave out to be their only ground. When the Scripture was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and clear, then I was reſolved to be fully ſatisfyed: but when the Scripture was not

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Epiſcopacy, condemned as Anti-Chriſtian by the Presbyterians.</head>
               <p>AS I knew the Church of Chriſt, which is often called in the Scripture, the kingdome of heaven, to be the moſt excellent Society, that ever was vpon earth, to tend to a moſt Spiritual and heavenly end, and to be direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by moſt holy and divine lawes: So I iuſtly conceived, that the goodneſſe and wiſdome of Chriſt, had eſtablished a moſt excellent order and forme, for the governement of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43743:36"/> kingdome, which he had founded vpon earth: and that, whoſoever would ſtrive to overturne that order and government, would be guilty of Spiritual Treaſon, and of Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Preſumption. We have had, for many yeares, furious contentions, in our Nation, concerning the governement eſtablished by Chriſt in his Church. The Bishops, who had governed from our infancy, were depoſed, at the beginning of the troubles; and their office was declared to be contrary vnto the purity of our firſt Reformation, to have no warrant in Gods word, and to be in it ſelf vnlawfull and Anti-Chriſtian. And, in place of Epiſcopacy, was brought in a parity of Miniſters, and the Presbyterian diſciplin; as the only governement eſtablished by Chriſt in his Church, and only conform to his word &amp;c. But after due triall, I found the Presbyterians, in all theſe matters, to come very short of their pretences.</p>
               <p>To begin then with our Reformation. I imagined, a good ſpace, that Epiſcopal gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement was not vſed, till many yeares after the Reformation: wherein I was deceived by two reaſons: 1. becauſe it was generally affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that King Iames brought firſt in Bishops, at the Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> anno 1606. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Puritanicall Miniſters were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to accuſe the Church of Scotland, for having fallen from her firſt love and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pretended, that they were to reduce all things, vnto the purity of their firſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I found the contrary in their owne
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43743:36"/> Records. For M. Knox his Chronicle sheweth, that, at the beginning of his Reformation, which happened in the yeare 1559. the Church newly planted, was governed by Super-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, who had authority over whole Shires, could ordaine and depoſe Miniſters, had a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtipend then others, and kept their places all their lifetimes. It expreſſeth alſo the manner of their election, and the names of thoſe, who were firſt choſen, with the bounds of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and iuriſdiction, as may be ſeen, in the ſaid Chronicle pag. 253. 284. and 325. of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don impreſſion. And what is this, but Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power vnder an other name? This gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement remain'd vnqueſtioned, the ſpace of 16. yeares, till M. Andrew Melvil, a man of a firie and Presbyterian Spirit, comming from Geneva, in the yeaere 1575. began to make factions, and by all means laboured to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the holy Geneva diſciplin, which he cry'd vp to the heavens, and as far abaſed the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal function, as a meere Anti-Chriſtian corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The whole matter is largely deſcribed,<note place="margin">Spots woord hiſt. lib <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>275.</hi>
                  </note> in the late Bishop of S. Andrewes hiſtory: where he sheweth, that the confuſion, troubles and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which the Presbyterian governement brought into the Church, and the Seditions it raiſed in the State, were ſo great; that K. Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, (who had often that ſentence in his mouth: <hi>No Bishop, No King</hi>) was forced, to reduce things vnto the firſt Reformation, and to reſtore Epiſcopacy. So that it's very evident, that the Presbyterians do falsly pretend, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43743:37"/> Epiſcopacy or Superiority of Paſtors, is againſt the purity of their firſt Reformation, and that parity of Miniſters, or Presbyterian governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is conform to it: the contrary being moſt certaine, out of their owne Records.</p>
               <p>Next, I found they came as little ſpeed of their pretence, of the word of God, which is ſo far from condemning Epiſcopacy, as evil and Anti-Chriſtian; that it rather commends it, as good and Chriſtian.<note place="margin">3. <hi>Tim. ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note> S Paul, writing to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee ſaith: <hi>This is a true</hi> (or faithfull) <hi>ſaying. If a man deſire a Bishops office, he deſireth a good worke.</hi> And that we may not contend about na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, I find the ſame S. Paul acknowledging, in Timothee, the power of iudging and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Presbyters, in which the power and Svperiority of Bishops principally conſiſts. For in the 5. chap. of the ſame epiſtle, he ſaith; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Presbyter, receive not an accuſation, but vnder two or three witneſſes.</hi> And ver. 22. <hi>Lay not thy hands ſuddenly on no man.</hi> He sheweth alſo, that he had left Titus, in the iſle of Crete, <hi>to ordaine Prieſts by cities.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. ch <hi>1.</hi> v. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> By this, I ſaw (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) clearly enough, that all Paſtors are not equall, but ſome are Superiour to others: and that a Bishop and a Miniſter is not the ſame, as the Presbyterians do pretend, ſince the one hath power to iudge and ordaine, which the other hath not. Therevpon, I made this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. If it be a true or faithfull ſaying (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) to call the office of Bishop good; Then it is neither a true nor faithfull ſaying to call it evil, as the Presbyterians ſpeaks. If the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43743:37"/> office of Bishop be a good worke then it was no good worke in the Presbyterians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, as Anti-Chriſtian. For that is not only to contradict the Scripture, but alſo to incurre the curſe threatned by the Prophet.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>More over Chriſt himſelf did inſtitute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe degrees of Paſtors in his Church, when he chooſed 12. Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Luce c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> and thereafter 72. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Now it appear'd very evident vnto me, that, as the Apoſtles were diſtinguished from the Diſciples, by their diverſe inſtitution,<note place="margin">Luce c. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> number, and more intire familiarity with Chriſt, by whom they were privily inſtructed; ſo they were in a higher degree and dignity, above the other Diſciples: which truth is much illuſtrated and confirmed by the ſolemn aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Matthias, who was before one of the Diſciples, vnto the Apoſtle ship,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</note> or as S. Peter sheweth, out of the Pſalmes, the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prike of Iudas. Laſtly, God did inſtitute, in the old Teſtament, diverſe degrees of the high Prieſts, the other Prieſts and Levits, as Calvin himſelf confeſſeth. Therefore it ſeem'd vnto me, there was no repugnancy,<note place="margin">Cal. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Inſt. c. <hi>6.</hi> §. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> why the like goodly Order and Subordination of Paſtors, might not alſo be, in the new Teſtament: yea rather all reaſon doth require, that theſe things ought to be, in the Church of Chriſt; and that more excellently and perfectly; then in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of the Iewes, ſince this is but a shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and type of the other.</p>
               <p>But although the Scriptures, being duely
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43743:38"/> conſidered, ſeemed clear enough, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet for more ſecurity, and to take away endleſſe ianglings, and wranglings, which ſome contentious heads, makes vpon the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt words of Scripture: I had my next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours vnto the interpretation of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; practiſe of the Primitive Church. And I found, that they did not only vnderſtand the Scriptures, for the Superiority of Bishops over other Paſtours: but alſo, they condemned the contrary opinion, as a wicked hereſy in Aerius. S. Auguſtin,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>19.</hi> de Ciu. c. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> explaining theſe words of S.

                  <note place="margin">Hier. ap. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. in hunc loc.</note> S. Hierom sheweth, that, in the primitive Church, the Office of a Bishop was the next degree to Martyrdome: for Bishops being the chiefe Leaders of Chriſtians, were moſt diligently ſearched out &amp; perſecuted by the Pagans. Therefore the Office of a Bishop being ſo high and excellent, ſo hard &amp; dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, it was no wonder, that the Apoſtle did require, ſo many excellent vertues and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in any,<note place="margin">Dion. lib. de Eccleſ. hier. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> who deſireth that office, which he call's <hi>a good worke.</hi> I will only adde to theſe, two moſt ancient Fathers, for confirmation of this truth. S. Denys Arcopagita the diſciple of S. Paul, deſcribing the Hierarchy, inſtituted by God, in the Church; putteth the Bishops, in the firſt place, the Prieſts in the ſecond, and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43743:38"/> Miniſters or Deacons in the third. And S. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius the diſciple alſo of the Apoſtles and Bishop of Antioch, doth shew this excellent ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Paſtours, in the Church: for thus he writes in one of his epiſtles. <hi>Prieſts be ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Bishop: Deacons, vnto Prieſts:</hi>

                  <hi>and you people, vnto Prieſts and Deacons. Who shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this comelineſſe of Order: I would willingly change my Soule with theirs; and our Lord be with them for ever.</hi> The Presbyterians have not only, not obſerved that comelineſſe of Order; but they have condemn'd it, and brought in the vglineſſe of confuſion and therefore, they want this holy Martyrs benediction. The holy Fathers also do conſtantly teach, that the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops do ſucceed vnto the Apoſtles, and the Prieſts vnto the 70. Diſciples: and therefore the Bishops: are greater, then the Prieſts. Yea the moſt eminent among all the holy Fathers, were Bishops although diverſe of them, were advanced to that dignity, much againſt their will. And beſids all theſe teſtimonies, I found the practice of the whole primitive Church, which was alwayes governed by B shops, from the beginning. I muſt profeſſe that conſidering all theſe things, I was fully ſatisfyed, and reſolved not to abandon all theſe authorities, of Scriptures, Fathers, and the whole ancient Church, for the Miniſters ſtrong cry's and bare words, which they only bring againſt them all.</p>
               <p>I was much confirmed in this reſolution, when I found the contrary opinion, concerning
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43743:39"/> parity of Paſtours, which is now maintayn'd by the Presbyterians, to be condemned, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hereſy, by the holy Fathers. S. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius writes thus of Aerius. <hi>His ſpeech was more furious, then became any man: for he ſaid what differs a Bishop from a Prieſt? there is no difference: the order is one, the honour one, and the dignity is the ſame.</hi> And confuting it a little after,<note place="margin">Epiph. haereſ. <hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> he ſaith: <hi>That this matter is full of fully, is manifeſt to all wiſe men. For that a Bishop and a Prieſt are not the ſame, the divine word of the Apoſtle doth teach.</hi> And after he hath proved, from the words of the Apoſtle above cited, that Bishops, who have power of Iudgeing Prieſts, are above Prieſts: then he proves alſo the Bishops Superiority, by their power of Ordination. <hi>How is it poſſible,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that a Bishop and a Prieſt can be equall? For that Order begetteth Fathers vnto the Church: but the other hath no power to beget Fathers, it only begets Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnto the Church, by the lauer of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not Fathers and Maſters. And how is it poſſible, that one can ordaine a Prieſt: who hath got no impoſition of hands,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>for Ordination?</hi> S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin alſo reckons vp this errour of Aerius, in his booke of hereſies. Yea S. Hierom, who, of all the holy Fathers, doth moſt extoll the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſtood, and brings it (as would ſeem) in ſome compariſon, with Epiſcopacy, excepts alwayes the power of Ordination: for thus he writes.<note place="margin">Hier. epist. ad Euagr.</note> 
                  <hi>What doth a Bishop, except Ordination, that a Prieſt doth not alſo?</hi> By all which, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that, if the Presbyterians had been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43743:39"/> above tuelve hundred yeares ago, they had been condemned, in this point, as Heretiques, by the holy Fathers; and that with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then the Aerians: who never proceeded to their hight of arrogance, to call the Office of Bishop, vnlawfull and Anti-Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Now againſt all this, what brings the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians for themſelves? pure Scripture; at leaſt they pretend ſo: which is an ordinary cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to all thoſe, whoſe errours are moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scripture. They bring ordinarly two places, wherein they have greateſt confidence. The firſt is Math. 20.26: where our Saviour ſaith vnto the Apoſtles. <hi>You know that the Princes of the Gentiles overrule them: and they that are the greater, exerciſe, power againſt them. It shall not be ſo among you, &amp;c.</hi> The like words are repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the 22. of S. Luke. v. 24. The ſecond place is 1. Tim. 4. v. 14. where the Apoſtle ſaith to Timothee: <hi>Neglect not the grace, that is in thee, which is given thee, by prophecie, with impoſition of the hands, of the Presbyterie,</hi> or of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: as ſome of their bibles tranſlates it.</p>
               <p>I conſidered diligently theſe places, and the reſt which they bring, and I could not find, in any of them, either Superiority of Paſtours condemned, nor Equality approved, much leſſe a Iudicatorie of 9. or 10. Miniſters, with a changeable Moderator, eſtablished to Iudge over their brethren, in all matters Eccleſiaſticall. There needs no more, to know the truth here, but to open our ey's and read the places: for impudence it ſelf cannot affirme, that the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43743:40"/> Scripture doth there expreſly condemn the one, or approve the other. Therefore, it's a vaine and falſe pretence of the Presbyterians, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their diſciplin to be contain'd expreſly in the Scripture. After expreſſe Scripture failes them, then they run to their owne gloſſes and Conſequences vpon the Scripiure, which they will have the people to believe, as Scripture: wherein they commit a double deceit. 1. To promiſe pure Scripture, and then in place of it, to give yow their owne gloſſes or rather gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which are not to be found in Scri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ture. 2. To oblige yow to believe, theſe gloſſes and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions to be Scripture, or as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As if one, who had promiſed, to give an other a quantity of gold, and in place of it, would give himonly braſſe: and then after this deceit, would alſo oblige him to eſteem the braſſe to be Gold. But albeit theſe gloſſes and conſequences be not in Scripture; yet it may be, they are cleare of themſelves and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarly deduced from the Scripture, as the Presbyterians pretends. I found this pretence alſo to be falſe. For if they were ſo evident and neceſſary: then men of iudgement would eaſily ſee ſuch gloſſes, and make ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. But the holy Fathers, who were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of great Iudgement, but were alſo moſt Eminent for learning and holyneſſe, never made any ſuch interpretations and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon the Scripture. Therefore the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian gloſſes, &amp;c. cannot be clear and evident, which ſuch holy and piercing ey's could not ſee;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43743:40"/> or if they ſaw them, it was only to condemn them, as hath been shewed. And albeit this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be more then ſufficient; to overthrow the pretended clearneſſe of all theſe new gloſſes: yet, when I conſidered, that the moſt learned of all the Proteſtants ſide: as all the Lutherans in Germanie, Suedland and Denmark, who have their Superintendents, and the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church of England, Scotland and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and which is to be much here conſidered, the Scottish Church at its firſt Reformation; never made any ſuch Interpretations vpon theſe Scriptures, but had their Bishops and Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents: then I eſteem'd it a madneſſe to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that theſe Presbyterian gloſſes could be clear and neceſſary: which neither: the holy Fathers, the whole primitive Church, and ſo many Learned Proteſtants, and all their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches could not ſee. And albeit the French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do admit of the Conſiſtorial diſciplin; yet, they do not declare Epiſcopacy, to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly Anti-Chriſtian, or that their forme is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian; much leſſe, do they think it ſo neceſſarie, as to overturne Kingdomes &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, for ſetting it vp. Of which Beza and du Moulin may be ſufficient witneſſes.<note place="margin">Beza cont. Erraſt. fol <hi>1.</hi> Monſ.

All which are very far, from the doctrines and practiſes of our Scottish Presbyterians; who ſtands very ſingle and bare, of all authority Divine and Humane; having all the world againſt them, not only the holy Fathers and whole ancient Church: but alſo all the old Proteſtants: both Lutherans and Calviniſts. And if we shall add vnto theſe, the Independents and Anabaptiſts, and other new Proteſtants, who admits of an equality, among Paſtours, but condemns Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian power and Tyranny; their ſmall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and number is yet much diminished, and the clearneſſe of their gloſſes is much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured Laſtly, if we will take away, from the Presbyterians number, all theſe, who, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or force, were gain'd vnto it; their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will appeare very ſlender, and the number of knowing and willing Presbyterians, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiderable: for now, when force hath fail'd them, many are dayly falling from them.</p>
               <p>As I found the Presbyterians deſtitute of all authority, to backe their new gloſſes; ſo I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their reaſons and Conſequences, to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43743:41"/> meer Sophiſmes: as this, which they wreſt out of our Saviours words, in S. Mathew above cited, doth shew. Chriſt, ſay they, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids ruleing among the Apoſtles, as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Gentiles vſed over their Subiects, ſaying: <hi>It shall not be ſo among yow; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will be the greater among you, let him be your ſervant &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, ſay they, none ought to be greater then an other, but all equal. And from this equality they inferre, that there ought, to be a Presbytery. Which is as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as if yow would ſay, the King or Supreme Magiſtrate forbids all domineering, or Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of his ſubordinate Iudges, ſuch as is vſed among the Turks: Therefore he forbids all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of one over an other, and makes all his Iudges equall: whereas indeed there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes no more, but that he forbiddeth Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Tyranny. After the ſame manner, Chriſt forbids among the Apoſtles, Heathenish Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anny, but not lawfull and Chriſtian Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Yea, doth not Chriſt propound himſelf, for an example, in the ſame place; and was not Chriſt Superiour to the Apoſtles? Therefore it's evident, he only requireth there, greater humility in thoſe, who were to be in greateſt dignity, as S. Hierom, writing on this place, doth obſerve. So that our Saviours words here, are ſo far from inferring an equality; that they neceſſarly ſuppoſe an inequality of Paſtours. And, if ſuch Presbyterian conſequences were admitted, they might, vpon the ſame ground, bring in a Levelling in the Civil, as wel as in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43743:42"/> the Eccleſiaſtical Eſtate. Yea, they would deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy their Presbyteries, which they would have only to ſtand; as the Independents do rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well againſt them. For it's much leſſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for tuentie or many to Domineer over their brethren, (as the Presbyterians have done, and would do) then for one, of worth &amp; vertue, to have &amp; exerciſe Chriſtian Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Iuriſdiction. As the old Proteſtants, do shew the falshood of the Presbyterians firſt conſequence, by which they would wreſt from our Saviours words an equality of Paſtours; ſo the Independents and other new Proteſtants do shew the falshood of their ſecond conſequence, by which, they would infer from that ſuppos'd equality, the governement of their Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For theſe new Congregations do admit equality; and yet will not heare of Presbytery. The like inſufficiency may be shewed of their gloſſes and conſequences, vpon that place of S. Paul to Timothee, where he ſpeaks of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: from which they would moſt ridiculouſly infer parity of Paſtours, and the whole plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of their diſciplin, with the power of their Soveraigne Iudicatory, which they call Presbytery. All which gloſſes and conſequences are not only againſt the ſenſe of the holy Fathers, and of the ancient Church; but alſo againſt the ſenſe and interpretation of almoſt all the old and new Proteſtants: which is ſufficient to shew them to be falſe and groundleſſe. And therefore for brevities ſake, we will not inſiſt longer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of them. This only may be obſerved by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43743:42"/> the way, that the Presbyterians, are brought to a hard ſtraight: when, for all their diſciplin, which they bragge is ſo clearly in Scripture, they are enforced to run to one word; and that alſo they muſt Etymologize and vnderſtand, againſt the ſenſe, of all Chriſtian Nations and Ages.</p>
               <p>But albeit the Presbyterian diſciplin cannot be found in the Scripture, nor Fathers, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any right reaſon be drawen from them; yet perhaps it may be good in it ſelf, and a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thing. Well then: we shall, according to to our Saviours rule, try it briefly by its fruits. It made indeed great promiſes of it ſelfe, and had ſome faire floorishes: but the fruits did not anſwer to expectation, neither were they proportionable to the great labour that was beſtowed in planting, nor to the aboundance of blood, that was shed for watering that vnhappy tree. Among many high commendations of Presbytery, which are collected in the 34. chap. of the Survey of the holy Diſciplin, it was ſaid in Queen Elyzabeths time <hi>The want of Presbytery is the cauſe of all evil. It's not to be hoped that any Commonwealth can floorish without it. Without this diſciplin, there can be no right religion. Theſe who reiect this diſciplin, refuſe Chriſt to raigne over them.</hi> At the beginning alſo of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in Scotland, the people were fed with large promiſes of the good of Presbytery. For then it was ſaid, that all Prelatical pride and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, should ceaſe: all innovations, should haue an end: the purity of the Goſpel, should be reſtored: and all bliſſings should be poured
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43743:43"/> downe with Presbytery vpon this Nation. Theſe were the promiſes &amp; floorishes of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery: but the fruits have proved iuſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For there was never more, yea hardly ever ſuch pride and Tyranny: never more Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: never greater miſeries and calamities: and never leſſe ſolid religion, and more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Atheiſme: as may appeare by reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on what hath been ſaid above. It cannot be denyed, (whatſoever the Government of the Church be) but our Saviour doth require meckneſſe and humility in the Governours of it; and yet the Covenanters (in the iudgement of many) haue carried themſelves, as if Chriſt had not required theſe vertues, but rather the contrary vices. Therefore, many of the wiſer ſort of thoſe in England, who were weary of Epiſcopacy, after they had taken a short Triall of Presbytery, ſoone ſmeld out the nature of it; and finding they had changed for the far worſt, and that their Conſciences were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by more heavy Taſk-maſters, they did quickly caſt off that heavy yoke; and ſo finding out a third way of Independency, haue many wayes, ſince that time, both outwitted, and over throwen the Presbyterians, by their owne weapons.</p>
               <p>To conclude this matter: I found after a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious triall, that Superiority of Paſtours, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme both to the old and new Teſtament: that Epiſcopacy, is ſo far from being Anti-Chriſtian and againſt Gods word; that it is moſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian and expreſly contain'd in the word of God,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43743:43"/> which was ſo vnderſtoode by the holy Fathers: and that this was the governement of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, in the pureſt times, when the office of a Bishop, was not ſo much a place of honour, as a worke of labour, and the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to Martyr-dome; as is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Bishops of Rome, thritie of which and above, did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, after S. Peter, shed their blood for Chriſt. And vpon the other part, I could not find parity of Miniſters, and the new diſciplin in the Scriptures: but rather, I found that it was againſt Scripture, againſt the holy Fathers, and the whole primitive Church: againſt ſound reaſon, and good governement: againſt many Proteſtant Churches, &amp; the learnedeſt men of that profeſſion: and againſt the practiſe of our firſt Reformers: and that it brought in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Church, and Tyranny over mens conſciences: that it was condemned, as an ancient hereſy, by the holy Fathers; and that, as an evil tree, it had lately produced much evil fruite. Therefore I could not abandon all theſe divine and humane authorities, theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt reaſons and experiences, which I found in confirmation of Epiſcopacy, and in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Presbytery, for the ſtrong cry's of ſome few paſſionat Miniſters: who, as they are deſtitute of all divine and humane authority; ſo they ſcarcely profeſſe to ſatisfy men in reaſon. They will haue their bare words, accompanyed with a ſigh or a grone, to be ſufficient, to oblige all men, to ſwear, and believe, all that they ſay or can invent; albeit you find never ſo great
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43743:44"/> authotity, yea and reaſon it ſelf to the contrary. It's knowen, how a great Apoſtle of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, cry'd out againſt ſome Miniſters, who, shortly after the beginning of theſe troubles, came to reaſon for Epiſcopacy, or to demand reaſon, for the abolishing it, and ſetting vp of Presbytery. <hi>Away, Away,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>with your reaſon; you muſt quite all reaſon, and help poore Chriſt a lift.</hi> Which he ſaid truly in a part. For any man, who would believe them, muſt quite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and more too.</p>
               <p>I found, at lenth, this matter concerning Epiſcopacy, or the governement of the Church, to be of greater conſequence, then many thinks, or I was at firſt aware of. For what can be more fundamental to the Church, then the Order and governement, which Chriſt hath eſtablis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed in it? What can be a more dangerous &amp; fundamental errour then to overthrow, yea, and accurſe that order and governement, which Chriſt had ſetled in it? If it be Treaſon in any Kingdome or Commonwealth, for any private faction, to overthrow the fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>damental Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is eſtablished in them by law; What high treaſon is it againſt Chriſt: to abrogate and accurſe that order and Governement, which he, with ſo great wiſdome, had ſetled in his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdome? Therefore if Epiſcopacy be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by Chriſt, and ſo be, <hi>iure diuino,</hi> as it appear'd ſufficiently to me for the reaſons lately touched;<note place="margin">In An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidot. by S. N. <hi>3.</hi> part. p. <hi>134.</hi>
                  </note> Then, as the Puritan Authour of the tuelue general arguments, reaſoneth well, and acknowledgeth ingenuoſly: <hi>The Churches of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43743:44"/> Scotland France Low Countries and other places.</hi> cannot be a true Church: but the Synagogue of Satan, contradicting therein both Chriſt &amp; his Goſpel. Moreover, if there can be no true Church without lawfull Paſtours; and no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtours can be without lawfull ordination; and none hath power of ordination except Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops alone, as the doctrin and practiſe of the ancient Church do shew: Then the deſtruction of Epiſcopacy brings alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g with it, the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all lawfull Paſtours, and ſo conſequently, of a true Church and Sacraments which is a moſt deſperat errour; as it was a moſt cruel Tyranny, to enforce others to ſwear and believe it, againſt their Conſciences.</p>

                  </gap>ay our Lords prayer: and the Miniſters themſelves did ordinarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their prayers with it. Chriſt made it, and the Scriptures containe it. So that we had not only the dignity of the Authour, &amp; the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures; but alſo the practiſe of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43743:45"/> the Miniſters, and of the whole people, to render the vſe of this divine prayer, laudable and profitable. But after the Presbyterians tooke vpon them to be Reformers, they abolis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed all ſet prayers, and this alſo was worne out of vſe, as well as the reſt. Yea, as they all neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, any more to ſay it, ſo there were ſome, who thought not that ſufficient, vnleſſe they ſpoke alſo too boldly againſt the vſe of it. I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee any probable pretence for this Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian innovation; which (as I am informed) ſeem's ſo ſtrange and incredible to ſtrangers, that they can hardly believe it. Therefore this alteration being ſo vnreaſonable, I did quickly diſcover the abſurdity of it.</p>

               <p>Becauſe the Presbyterians, pretended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, to reduce all things to the purity of our firſt Reformation; I informed my ſelf of the practiſe of our Reformers; and I found they made publique vſe of this prayer; as may be ſeen in M.

                  <note place="margin">Tertull. lib. de Oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> Tertullian calls our Lords prayer. <hi>Tho Breviarie, or Compend, of the Euangel</hi> And ſaith: <hi>that how much it is shortned in words, it is as much enlarged in ſenſes.</hi> But there needeth not much commendation of the worke, to thoſe who know the Excellency of the Authour. The ſame S. Cyprian doth shew the great efficacy of this prayer, in theſe excellent words.<note place="margin">Cypr. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Since we haue Chriſt, an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocat with our father, for our ſins; when we ſinners do ſupplicat for our offences; let vs bring forth the words of our Aduocat. For when he ſaith: what euer you aske from the Father, in my name, he will giue it vnto you: how much more efficaciouſly, shall we obtaine what we aske in Chriſts name; if we aske it by his owne prayer?</hi> And againe, he call's it a friendly &amp; familiar prayer, to pray God with his owne: to make the prayer of Chriſt, aſcend
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43743:46"/> vnto his eares. <hi>The Father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the words of his Son: when he who dwelleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the heart, is alſo outwardly in the tongue.</hi> S. Auguſtin, in the place lately cited, doth shew alſo the vertue of this prayer, when he ſaith: that the dayly ſaying of it, doth ſatisfy for our dayly and light offences, without which this life is not led. Therefore the Presbyterians by neglecting to ſay this prayer, did deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelv's, of the benefite, of the moſt excellent, and efficacious of all prayers. And therefore, albeit they tooke exception, againſt all ſet formes of prayer, which were made by men, and would ſay them no more; yet they might haue alway's excepted this prayer, which was made by God: both for the excellency of it ſelf, and the dignity of the Authour. But all were put in the ſame Category. Yea, there were ſome of the deepeſt Presbyterian dye, who did not think it ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to neglect the ſaying of it: vnleſſe they ſpoke alſo irreuerently, againſt the vſe of it. And there were ſome ſo vnreaſonable, that they would maintaine, it was not only vnprofitable to ſay our Lords prayer; but alſo vnlawfull. We noted above, how a great Apoſtle of the Covenant, called publickly, the vſe of ſaying often our Lords prayer, <hi>a Papiſtical charme.</hi> An other Miniſter in Galloway did glory (as I was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a perſon of knowen honeſty) that he had banished, out of his parish, two Idols: <hi>to witt, Our Father &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>God of all glory and peace &amp;c.</hi> Which was a short grace, that was ſaid ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after meate: for all graces, as well as prayers,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43743:47"/> behoved to be extemporary, even among the Laiques, who intended to be in the right Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Mode. But as that perſon, to whom this Miniſter ſpoke, anſwered him well, ſaying: <hi>If you haue banished theſe two, which you call Idols: I feare you shall bring in worſe Idols in their place.</hi> So it fell forth. For in place of that diuine, short, and excellent prayer, made by God: we got long, tedious, inconſiderat prayers, made <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> by men; which, for the moſt part, were full of Tautologies, and idle bablings. As Tertullian ſaid well of our Lords prayer. <hi>That it was short in words, but large in ſenſes:</hi> So the contrary may be ſaid, not vnfitly, of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians extemporary prayers: <hi>They were large in words, but very short of ſenſe.</hi> And this was the Noble exchange that we made: which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was for the worſt.</p>
               <p>Seing then it's evident, that our Lords pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, is the moſt excellent of all prayers; that it was made by Chriſt for our vſe: that it was hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghly eſteem'd, and frequently vſed by the holy Fathers, and the primitive Church: that it's moſt efficacious to obtaine from God all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit's; and beſid's, that it was ſaid publickly, by our firſt Reformers, and is yet vſed by all the old Proteſtants; I could not approve the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians innovation, of forbearing to ſay it. Much leſſe could I approve, the irreverent, or rather blaſphemous opinion, of ſome, who maintain'd, that it was both vnprofitable, and vnlawfull to vſe it: which I found alſo to haue been maintain'd, many yeares ago, by the Brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43743:47"/> and Puritans: as may be ſeen <hi>in Britanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machia Miniſtror. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>dogm. 13.14.</hi> For what is the authority of Presbytery, againſt all theſe authorities, which are brought for the laudable vſe of our Lords prayer? And how much leſſe is it to be eſteemed; ſince this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, did not proceed from any general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of the whole Miniſtery: but from ſome few giddy domineering heads, which Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed over the reſt, and made them to follow their example. For now, ſince Presbyterian power is a little quailed, diuerſe Miniſters, are clinging in againe, to their old cuſtome, of ſaying this divine prayer; which they may do now, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout danger.</p>
               <p>I admired much, when a Catholique friend shew me,<note place="margin">Gualter Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nol. ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul. <hi>11.</hi> cap. de Vval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore <hi>29.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Glory to the Father &amp;c. or of the hymne of Glorification, taken away by the Presbyterians.</head>
               <p>FROM the reformation of our Lords pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, which was ſaid to our heavenly father; the Presbyterians proceeded next, to reforme, or rather to abolish the hymne of Glory, which was ordinarly ſung in praiſe of the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This Innovation ſeem'd very ſtrange, and gaue great ſcandal to many. For beſids, that it had been vſed from our infancy, and was ſung publickly in all Churches, at the concluſion of of the Pſalmes: it contain'd not the leaſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of evil, but rather, did appear to tend much, to the honour of God, to whom all praiſe &amp; glory principally belongs. And albeit it be not, word by word, in one place of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43743:48"/> as our Lords prayer is; yet the ſenſe, and the like words, if not the ſame, are to be found in it. For what is more expreſly contain'd in the new Teſtament, then the Father, Son, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, in whoſe name we are all baptized: and which, all true Chriſtians do acknowledge to be one true God? And what is more cleare in Scripture, then that Glory is due vnto God? S Paul ſaith: <hi>to the King of the worlds, immortal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Pet</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>ch. ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Iude ver.</hi> 25.</note> 
                  <hi>inviſible, only God, be honour and glory for ever. Amen.</hi> S. Peter alſo ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith: <hi>to him be Glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</hi> And S. Iude: <hi>to the only God our Saviour, by Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, be Glory &amp; magnificence, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and power, before all worlds, and now, &amp; for all worlds evermore. Amen.</hi> There is nothing more freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then redoubling of this Glory to God. S. Iohn ſaith, that he heard every Creature, in heaven and vpon earth, ſaying:<note place="margin">

S. Iohn ſaith, he heard a voice come out from the throne, ſaying.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Say praiſe to our God all you his Servants: and you that feare him, little and great.</hi> Why then should the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians hinder both little &amp; great, to ſing this hymne of praiſe &amp; Glory vnto the holy Trinity? Why should they goe againſt their owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practiſe, and that cuſtome which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43743:49"/> by their firſt Reformers, and which is yet keep't in all the more ancient Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? How could one of their Miniſters inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the people, when they were ſinging that hymne, by crying out no leſſe ridiculouſly then ſcandalouſly: <hi>No more Glory to the Father: No more Glory?</hi> Indeed, if the Presbyterians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the myſtery of the holy Trinity, as the Arians did, they might vpon that falſe ground, had ſome pretence of reaſon, for this innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but acknowledging the truth of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine myſtery, they appear'd very vnreaſonable for abolishing that hymne, which was ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid in praiſe of it, and which hath ſo good ground in the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Being therefore deſirous, to know this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the ſource, I had my next recourſe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my accuſtomed methode) vnto the primitive Church, &amp; the holy Fathers. And there I found that this hymne was moſt ancient, &amp; an Apoſtolical tradition: that it was highly eſteem'd, and much vſed by the Catholique Church in the primitive times: that as ſome heretiques did much endeavour to pervert it; ſo the Catholiques did labour as diligently to preſerve it, in the ſame purity, as it had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vnto them, by continual practiſe and tradition. And laſtly, I found, that God did approve the laudable vſe of this hymne, by ſome notable miracles.

               <p>How the hymne of Glorification was vſed, from the very tyme of the Apoſtles, S. Baſil the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43743:49"/> Great doth largely shew. For when the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme was adminiſtrated by them, in name of the Father, &amp; of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt, the faithfull anſwered: <hi>Glory be to the Father, &amp; to the Son, and to the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Which cuſtome of glorifying God; the ſame holy father doth affirme to be an Apoſtolical tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had been every where obſerved, throughout the whole Church. Of this matter, Cardinal Baronius treateth amply, in his third tome, anno 325. Where he alſo sheweth, that this hymne was of ſo great authority and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, in the ancient Church, that, when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers, in the Councel of Conſtantinople, were to eſtablish a rule of faith, againſt ſome Heretiques, who denyed the Divinity of the holy Ghoſt; they would haue inſerted in that Symbol, a teſtimony from this hymne of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the Divinity of the holy Ghoſt, in theſe words: <hi>Who with the Father and the Son;</hi>

Therefore the great Councel of Nice,<note place="margin">Baron. ibid. n. <hi>176.</hi>
                  </note> which had condem-the Arian hereſy, for the more confuſion of it, gave order to continue theſe hymnes in the Church, which were in vſe to be ſung former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in praiſe of the holy Trinity, and eſpecially the hymne of Glorification, which the Arians had changed and endeavoured to pervert, as they had impiouſly denyed the myſtery of the holy Trinity, in whoſe honour it was ſaid. And from this time, that hymne began to be more frequently vſed; ſo that the Countrey people would ſing it, whilſt they were buſied about their ordinary labours. For how much the Arians did ſtrive to ſuppreſſe and pervert it; ſo much the Catholiques did labour to preſerve and celebrat it. For which cauſe, S. Ambroſe did conclude all the new hymnes, which he made, to be ſung by the people, during the time of the perſecution which he ſuffered of the Arians, with the hymne of Glorification, as S.

What is more powerfull then the Confeſſion of the Trinity, which is celebrated every day by the mouths of the people? They labour all earneſtly to confeſſe the faith: they know to praiſe in verſe, the Father, Son &amp; holy Ghoſt: and they are all become Teachers, who ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43743:50"/> could haue been Schollers.</hi> Yea, to confound yet more the Arians, who blaſphemouſly ſaid, that the Son was made by the father in time, and that there was a time, when he was not, the holy Councel of Nice was pleaſed to add vnto the ancient hymne of Glorification, <hi>Glory to the father &amp;c.</hi> That appendix: <hi>As it was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, &amp; now, and ever shall be, world without end, Amen.</hi> Which clauſe did appeare in my iudgment, as a propheſie, ſerving not only for the confuſion of the Arians, but alſo of the Presbyterians.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Chriſtians of old, vere ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull, to preſerve the integrity of this hymne, as it had been delivered vnto them by their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Anceſtors; that they would not ſuffer ſo much as one ſyllable of it to be altered: So that diverſe of the faithfull did take offence at ſome expreſſions of great S.

By this, and diverſe other experiences, I perceived, how carefull the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians were, to preſerve the purity of divine truths, &amp; of Apoſtolical traditions; that they would not quite not alter ſo much as one ſyllable of them, to pleaſe all the Heretiques in the world. What would they thought then of the Presbyterians, who haue not taken away on ſyllabe; but the whole ſentence and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of this hymne?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I found that God hath been pleaſed, to approve the laudable vſe of this divine hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, by miracles. For, whereas diuerſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques had their tongues cut out, by the wicked &amp; cruel Arians, in the perſecution, which they endured vnder Hunericus the Arian King of the Wandals; by the admirable power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt they ſpoke diſtinctly without their ton<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gues, and did celebrate the divinity of Chriſt: as Baronius sheweth, by the teſtimony of irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable witneſſes,<note place="margin">Baron. tom. 5. anno <hi>484.</hi>
                  </note> as of Iuſtinian the Emperour, and diverſe others, who ſaw ſome of them with their eyes, and beard them ſpeake. Which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo Cornelius a Lapide doth touch, in his Commentaire on the 8. ch. to the Rom: v. 28.

                  </note> how Hildebrand the Popes Legat in France (who became there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after Pope Gregory the 7.) did, by this hymne miraculouſly diſcover diverſe Simoniack Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, in that Kingdome-For when one time, a learned and eloquent Bishop was accuſed of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony before him, which he would by no means confeſſe, being ſuddenly commanded by the Legat to ſay: <hi>Glory be to the Father &amp; to the Son, &amp; to the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> he pronounced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed clearly and diſtinctly the Father &amp; the Son; but by no means could he pronounce the Holy Ghoſt. By which miracle he was moved to confeſſe his fault, &amp; to quite his Bishopri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que: after which confeſſion, he pronounced diſtinctly the whole hymne. Diverſe other Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack Bishops, in that Countrey, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſame miracle, to do the ſame. So that God Almighty, for approving the vſe of this heavenly hymne, hath made his approved Servants, who wanted their tongues, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to pronounce it: and from theſe, who had tongues, but vere vnworthy, he tooke away even their natural power to vtter it.</p>
               <p>What shall we ſay then of this inconſiderat Presbyterian ſect, which hath outſtripped the Arians, the moſt wicked of all Heretiques?

Yea, in an other conſideration, the Preſbyterians appeare, in this point, to be worſe then the Arians. For theſe Heretiques, denying the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the holy Trinity, by oppoſing one or two places of Scripture (which they did pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly &amp; falſly expound) to the conſtant &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient belief of the whole Chriſtian world; did rationally, ſuppoſing theſe ill principles, to change the hymne of Glorification, which was ſaid in in honour of the holy Trinity, yea, if they could, to haue altogether abolished it: which doubtleſſe they had done, if shame could haue permitted them. But they left this effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted action to the Presbytery, which is more paſſionat and leſſe rational, then the Arians. For the Presbyterians pretending to believe the myſtery of the holy Trinity, haue moſt irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally abolished that hymne of Glory, which had been ſaid in honour of it, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſtianity. I was much aſtonished, when I conſidered, into what miſeries &amp; rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, inconſiderat paſſion, &amp; furious zeal do drive men, who vnder pretence of greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, &amp; of more cloſe adhering to the Sriptures, ſtray alway's further from them, and fall into greater impurity and defile themſelv's with more filthie errours.</p>

               <p>This innovation, shortly after it came in, was very hardly preſs'd againſt me, by a Roman Catholique of my acquentance: who tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion therevpon, to ſay vnto me. What is the reaſon, that M. Knox your firſt Reformer, whom you eſteem no ſmall light, did not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the hymne of Glorification, as your Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians haue lately done? Or, if he did not ſee all things, how could it eſcape the sharp eyes of theſe two famous firſt Apoſtles, Luther &amp; Calvin, whom you believe to haue bein ſent extraordinarly by God, to reforme the Church? They neither ſaw, nor could ſee any thing blameable in it. When he ſaw, that I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing, but only blamed the Presbytery, for their inconſideration &amp; inconſtancy, which indeed was all that I could ſay: he told me that S. Paul manifeſteth the true Source of this, &amp; the like innovations. For, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of falſe Teachers, he ſaith: <hi>Evil men, and Seducers, shall wax worſe, erring &amp; driving into errour.</hi> So, that,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim,</hi> 3.13.</note> what the firſt Reformers (who could not on a ſuddaine deny all truths) left vntouched, your ſecond Presbyterian Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers haue abolished: as they haue done here the hymne of Glory, which was ſaid in praiſe of the holy Trinity: and for which, you haue got the noble exchange of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual praiſes of the Covenant &amp; Presbytery. But as the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Nice did add vnto the ancient hymne of Glory <hi>to the Father</hi> &amp;c. that clauſe. <hi>As it was in the beginning &amp;c.</hi> For confuſion of the Arian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy: So alſo it hath, by the ſame addition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43743:53"/> foretold the continuance of it for ever, to the confuſion of this new ſect called Presbytery, which is moſt conſonant to that of S. Paul: <hi>To God be glory in the Church, and in Chriſt Ieſus to all generations, world without end Amen.</hi>

Thus ended my Catholique friend: whoſe words I found to be more waighty; a good ſpace after, then they appear'd to me, at the time, when he ſpoke them. Moreover, I remember he deſired me to conſider, that theſe innovations againſt our Lords prayer, and the hymne of Glory, were ſuch blacke actions; that the prime Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians who introduced them, were ashamed to make acts to forbid them, as they had done for abolishing of Epiſcopacy, and ſome other points; but only brought them in by a deſuetude, as they ſpeake, and ſo wore them out of vſe.

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Apoſtles Creed, denyed to be Apostolical, by the Presbyterians.</head>
               <p>THERE was hardly any thing, that the Preſbyterians did, which made me ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo much; as their Innovation, concerning the authority of the Apoſtles Creed. They were not content with their Reformation, or rather abrogation of the Apoſtolique governement, vnleſſe they alſo did deny the Creed to be made by the Apoſtles, and ſo weare it out of vſe, as they had done our Lords prayer. At the end of of their new Catechiſme, they ſpeake thus of the Creed:<note place="margin">Shore Cat. Vveſt. in fine.</note> 
                  <hi>Albeit the ſubſtance of the doctrine compriſed in the Abridgement, commonly called the Apoſtles Creed, be fully ſet forth in each of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmes, ſo as there is no neceſſity of inſerting the Creed it ſelf; yet it is here annexed, not as though it were compoſed by the Apoſtles &amp;c.</hi> In which words, they reach covertly two things. 1. That the Creed it ſelf is not neceſſary, if we have the ſubſtance of it, as it is explain'd in the new Presbyterian Catechiſme. 2. that it needs not be eſteemed, to be compoſed by the Apoſtles. But their practiſe did shew more evidently their meaning. For they did not only declare it, not to be Apoſtolical, and therefore to be only a humane collection: but alſo they did no more ſay it, neither did they require it to be ſaid any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43743:54"/> more of others; as the cuſtome was formerly at Baptiſmes. And by theſe means, they put it out, both of eſtimation and vſe.</p>
               <p>This innovation gave great ſcandal to many, who thought iuſtly, they could thereafter be ſure of nothing, ſince their Creed was called in queſtion. This was vniverſally eſteem'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Covenant began, the badge or mark of a Chriſtian, and the principal foundation of the Chriſtian religion. The authority of it was held ſo ſacred, that it was an ordinary proverbe in mens mouth's, when they would give great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of performing any thing they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: <hi>that before they failed. They would as ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne deny their Creed.</hi> As it was called the Apoſtles Creed; ſo it was taught for ſuch. &amp; ſo it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and eſteemed to be. It was publickly ſaid, in the Church, by parents, at the Baptiſme of their Children; and it was required to be ſaid by the people, when they were Catechized. But all theſe things were altered and overturned by the Presbyterians. The authority and eſteem of the Creed was dash't, by their denying it to be Apoſtolicall: and the cuſtome of ſaying it, both publikly &amp; privatly, was taken away; ſo that it was ſoone worne out, both of vſe and requeſt. If they did this ſo eaſily with our Lords prayer, which is contain'd in Scripture; how much more eaſily would they do it with the Creed, which is not in Scripture and which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be a meer humane collection? And ſo, in a short time, they would get it to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlighted, as a humane invention, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43743:54"/> out of the memories of men.</p>
               <p>Wherefore being deſirous to penetrat this matter more inwardly, I found after ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that the ſame grounds, which can be brought for the Apoſtolique authority of the Scriptures, are alſo brought, and that in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree, for the like authority of the Creed. And therefore, if we receive the one, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reiect the other. I shall briefly collect, what I found, or hath been shewed vnto me, for the Apoſtolique authority, great excellency, &amp; frequent laudable vſe of this diuine Symbol.<note place="margin">Baron. tom. <hi>1.</hi> Annal. an. <hi>44.</hi> n. <hi>15.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note> Cardinal Baronius in the 1. tome of his Annals doth shew, by the teſtimony of the holy &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, that the Creed was compoſed by the holy Apoſtles, a little before they were to part, and goe into ſeveral Countries, to preach the Goſpel vnto the Gentils: to the end there might be a certaine, short, clear rule of faith, in which they all agreed, wherein they were to inſtruct all perſons, and by which, as by a certaine badge, all Chriſtians might he knowen. For this cauſe, it was not committed to writing; but was delivered by lively voice, and imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the hearts of Chriſtians, by the faithfull diligence of the Apoſtles.

S. Baſil doth reckon the Apoſtles Creed, as a principal Apoſtolique tradition. And, in a word, I found that all Chriſtian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ages, have borne teſtimony of this truth.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I found that in the primitive times, this Symbol was holden in ſo great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that in General Councels, it vſed to be firſt recited,<note place="margin">Baron vbi ſu. pra.

                  </note> And S.

               </p>
               <p>As I found ſuch greet teſtimonies to prove the Apoſtolique authority of the creed; ſo I did find, that the holy Fathers, did highly praiſe the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it, as of a worke worthy of ſuch diuine Architects. S. Auguſtin calls it.<note place="margin">Aug. ſer. <hi>42.</hi> de trad. Symb.</note>

For whatſoever is prefigured in the Patriarchs, whatſoever is declared in the Scriptures, or foretold by the Prophets. &amp;c. is contain'd, and briefly confeſsed in it.</hi> And in his Sermon above cited <hi>de Traditione Symboli,</hi> ſpeaking of the Creed, he ſaith: <hi>Theſe are not humane words, but heavenly myſteries of our Lord.</hi> But moſt notable and efficacious are the words of Rufinus to this purpoſe. <hi>The Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rufin. in praef. de expoſ. Symb.</note> ſaith he, <hi>being to part from one an other to preach, they lay'd downe this marke of their faith and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Not as the children of Noe being to part from each other, rearing vp a tower of bricke and ſlime, whoſe top should reach vnto the heauens: but building the fortreſſes of faith, of liuely ſtones, and heavenly pearles, which should ſtand ſtedfaſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43743:56"/> againſt the face of the enemy: which neither the winds should shake, nor floodes ſubvert, nor boyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous ſtormes or tempeſts move. They therefore being to ſeparate, building the tower of Pride, were deſervedly punished with the Confuſion of tongues, that not one could vnderſtand the ſpeech of his neighbour: but theſe, who built the tower of Faith, were endued with the skill and knowledge of all languages; to the end, that the one might be the marke of Sin, and the other the monument of Faith.</hi> Thus Ruffinus.</p>
               <p>Laſtly; the ſame holy Fathers do shew the frequent laudable vſe of the Apoſtles Creed, in the primitive Church. It was firſt taught and delivered vnto thoſe, who deſired Baptiſme; and it was required to be publickly ſaid by them immediatly before their baptiſme. This cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me (as Ruffinus sheweth) was carefully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Roman Church.<note place="margin">Ruffin. ibid vt ſupra.</note> S. Auguſtin alſo doth witneſſe, how the God-fathers did ſay it, in name of the Infants whom they preſented to Baptiſme: and therefor he earneſtly exhorts every Chriſtian, when he comes to the yeares of diſcretion, to ſay frequently the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Creed, which he profeſſed by the mouths of thoſe, who preſented him to Baptiſme, and call's it the Mirrour of a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>Render</hi> ſaith he, <hi>your Symbol render it vnto the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. homil. <hi>42.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>be not weary to rehearſe it: the repetition of it is good, leaſt forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe creep on thee. Do not ſay: I ſaid it yeſternight I ſaid it to day, I ſay it every day, I haue it well. Remember thy faith: behold thy ſelf: Let thy Creed be a Mirrour vnto thee, there ſee thy ſelf if
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43743:56"/> thou believe all, that thou confeſſes thy ſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and reioyce dayly in thy faith. Let it be thy riches, the dayly Apparell of thy Soule. Do you not cloath your ſelf when you riſe? So by remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy Creed, cloath thy Soule, leaſt peradventure forgetfulneſſe make it naked.</hi> S. Ambroſe calls it the <hi>Seale</hi> of our heart, which we ought dayly to review; and the <hi>Watch-word</hi> of a Criſtian,<note place="margin">Amb. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nib. tom. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> which should be in readineſſe, in all dangers.</p>
               <p>By all which irrefragable teſtimonies, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred authority, great excellency, and frequent laudable vſe, both in publick and private, of the Apoſtles Creed, did appeare ſufficiently vnto me. So that I found, for it, the conſent of peoples and Nations; the teſtimonies of the holy Fathers, the Martyrs, Saints, and Chriſtians of all ages: that is of the Vniuerſal Church, the piller &amp; ground of truth: which are the greateſt aſſurances, that can be had vpon earth. And therefore I reſted fully ſatisfyed with them. But I was much more confirmed in this reſolution, when I vnderſtood by a ſerious conference with a friend; that there was the ſame certainty for the Creed, that there is for the Scriptures; to witt the Tradition or teſtimony of the Church. S. Auguſtin delivers clearly this truth, concerning the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Aug. cont. epiſt. fund. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I would not haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Euangel, unleſse the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Catholique Church had moved me &amp;c. and that authority being once weakned, neither can I believe the Euangel.</hi> This teſtimony &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Catholique Church, was proved to me, to be the moſt eaſy, manifeſt, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43743:57"/> ordinary way, that can be had on earth, to come vnto the certaine knowledge of what books are Scriptures: yea it was clearly proved to be the only way: ſo that, if once this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony be weakened, there is nothing left, but gueſſings &amp; wanderings, after the manner of blind men; as experience doth shew in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, between the Lutheraniſts &amp; the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts, who agree in all their ſuppoſed wayes of knowing the Scripture; and yet can never agree in the ſame Canon of the Scriptures. But of this matter, we shall haue occaſion to ſpeake more fitly hereafter, in the queſtion of the Church.</p>
               <p>If then the Scriptures cannot be certainly knowen, but by the teſtimony &amp; authority of the Church, and are to be believed for the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as S. Auguſtin doth affirme; the Creed alſo may be knowen, and ought to be believed to be Apoſtolical, for the ſame very reaſon; ſince the ſame teſtimony &amp; authority are for both. Yea the Tradition &amp; Teſtimony of the Church, for the Apoſtles Creed, hath, in a certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſome preeminence, above that which is for the Scripture. For it is more ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; more vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal; &amp; more manifeſt. More ancient: becauſe the holy Fathers and the whole Church, do conſtantly affirme, that the Symbol was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Apoſtles, before any part of the new Teſtament was written. It was more vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal: becauſe it was received every where, at the very firſt plantation of Chriſtianity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas diverſe parts of the Scripture, being direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43743:57"/> only to ſome particular Churches, could not be communicated, but after ſome ſpace, to the whole Church. It was alſo more manifeſt: becauſe there were ſome bookes of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doubted of, by ſome of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, till the Vniverſal Church did determin the Canon of the Sciptures: but there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ancient Chriſtian, who doubted of, or denyed the Apoſtles Creed, there was ſuch a clear and Vniverſal tradition for it. And beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; the Creed, in it ſelf, is very clear; as being a short rule of faith, ordain'd for the capacity of the moſt ſimple; according to which, the Scriptures, that are more obſcure, ought to be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>Seing then the whole Church, in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, and in all ages, hath profeſſed that the Apoſtles made &amp; taught the Creed; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines moſt certaine, that the Apoſtles did teach it: for greater certainty then this, cannot be had. If the Apoſtles taught, and delivered it vnto the firſt Chriſtians; then they being ſo taught, were obliged to receive it, with the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me reverence, wherewith they did receive the Scriptures, which were delivered or direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them, by the ſame Apoſtles. And if the firſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, were ſo obliged, why not alſo their children &amp; their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s children, &amp; ſo downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age, vntill the end of the world, shall haue the ſame obligation? If this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held in the firſt age; why not alſo in the ſecond, and in every ſucceeding age? Or when should this obligation ceaſe? Or why more at
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43743:58"/> one time, then at an other; ſince the ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance remaines at all times? Or why should it ceaſe more for the Creed, then for the Scripture; ſince the ſame teſtimony is for both? and if there be any preeminence in this matter, the Creed hath it; as has been shewed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as I was, by theſe conſiderations, fully ſatisfyed of the Apoſtolique authority &amp; lau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dable vſe of the Creed, in the primitive Church, ſo I could in no wiſe approve the Presbyterians innovations againſt it: but rather did much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire of their preſumption. For by their denying the Creed to be Apoſtolique, I ſaw they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the clear rule, and endeavoured to ſubvert the very foundation of the Chriſtian faith. By their taking away both the publick and private vſe of it, they would haue robbed Chriſtians, of the heavenly apparell and ſpiritual armour of their ſoules, as the holy Fathers above call it. And all this they do, relying vpon no other grounds but their owne geſſes; which they oppoſe, and would haue to be preferred to the conſtant teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and irrefragable authority of the whole Chriſtian world.

But the Presbyterians bring neither ſleeping nor waking witneſſes; and yet they will blindly iudge, in a matter done above 16. hundred yeares ago, and boldly pronounce ſentence againſt an ancient funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truth, which had been received &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43743:58"/> by the Chriſtians of all ages. But albeit the Presbyterians do reiect the authority, &amp; teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Church, yet I ſaw (if they follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed their owne principles) they might as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, diſcern the Creed to be Apoſtolique; as they pretend they can know the Scriptures. For the Maieſty of the ſtyle, the harmony of the parts, the purity of the doctrin, and the like, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the Creed, in an eminent degree, as we haue ſeen above out of the holy Fathers who do ſo highly praiſe it, for its perfections, as a worke Worthy of ſuch heavenly Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects. And the matter being conſidered in it ſelf, the Creed in all theſe qualities, is equal, if not Superiour, by outward apparance, vnto the Scriptures. For in them, there are many ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming contradictions hard to be explained: but none in this. Many things in Scripture, not ſo full of Maieſty, as about S. Pauls cloke &amp;c.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13.</note> but the creed is totally replenished, with moſt ſublime &amp; divine myſteries. Therefore, if the Presbyterians could by theſe marks diſcern the Scriptures, they might as eaſily diſcern the Creed to haue been made by the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Albeit I admired much, how the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians could vpon ſo weake grounds, deny the Apoſtles Creed, againſt ſuch invincible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; yet I was much more ſtricken with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, when I conſidered, what they brought in place of it. For in place of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed, we got the Presbyterians Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. As that was denyed to be Apoſtolical; ſo this was cry'd vp to be Divine: for it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43743:59"/> 
                  <hi>Gods Covenant; the Confeſſion of faith &amp;c.</hi> As parents were accuſtomed, at the Baptiſme of their children, to ſay the Apoſtles Creed, in which they promiſed to bring them vp; ſo now they were made promiſe, to breede them in the Covenant, which was too long to haue by heart, or to be repeated. This was truly a rare exchange; to deny the Creed to be Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, &amp; to cry vp the Covenant to be Divine. To rob vs of a moſt ancient, clear, briefe, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Sacred Confeſſion of faith made by the holy Apoſtles, famous in all ages, &amp; vniverſally received troughout the whole world, full of great myſteries, &amp; divine expreſſions: And to give vs, in place of it, a new, long, obſcure, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Confeſſion, or rather Confoſſion of faith, full of terrible oaths, execrations &amp; combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deviſed by ſome few diſcontented heads, &amp; by cunning and force, obtruded vpon this Nation; much ſuſpected, at the beginning, to be nothing but a meer pretence of religion; as it was notoriouſly knowen to be a humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; and as it's now at lenth, after all its diſguiſes, manifeſted for ſuch vnto the world. It's good fame hath not laſted long, neither at home nor abroad. It got ſome foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in England, by cunning and worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; but theſe ſoone failing, it was quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and reiected. The Chriſtlan Moderator ſaith to this purpoſe.<note place="margin">Chriſt. Mod. p. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That the laſt Reformation ſetled with ſo ſolemn a Covenant, and caried on with ſo furious a zeal, is already, by better lights diſcovered, to be meerly humane, &amp; therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly lay'd aſide</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:43743:59"/>
               <p>Therefore to conclude this point: I found clearly, that the Creed hath been alwayes held to be, &amp; is Apoſtolique: that it is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; perfect rule of the Chriſtian faith: that it is a worke worthy of the holy Apoſtles: that it is ſuch a ſtrong &amp; heavenly fabricke, that it cannot be overthrowen by no ſtormes nor tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, by no force nor violences, and that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all hereſies: that the ancient cuſtome of ſaying it publickly at Baptiſme, and often pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly, and dayly, is moſt laudable and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſtian people. And vpon the other part, I found, that the Presbyterians, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Cred to be Apoſtolique, haue denyed the foundation &amp; clear rule of the Chriſtian faith, &amp; moſt vnreaſonably haue worne out, both the publick &amp; private vſe of it: And that they compleated their new Raformation, when they not only reiected the Creed; but obtruded the Covenant in place of it. And laſtly I found, that as the Presbyterians new doctrin in this matter, is moſt erroneous and preſumptuous; ſo that all their endeavours, have proved vaine &amp; frivolous. For that fortreſſe of faith, which was built by the holy Apoſtles, of lively ſtones, &amp; heavenly pearles, as Ruffinus ſpeaks, hath held out ſtronger tempeſts, then the Presbyterians weake blaſts; and therefore it ſtill ſtands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. Whereas the Babel of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which they were ſo diligently building, and vpon which they could never get the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, as they often regrated, hath ended in Confuſion, and in a short ſpace hath come to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43743:60"/> ruine. Now, all theſe things being conſidered, I refer my ſelf to any man, voyde of paſſion, if I could reaſonably, much leſſe Chriſtianly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the pearles of the Apoſtles Creed, for the droſſe of the Presbyterians Covenant.</p>

               <p>AFTER that the Presbyterians had thus endeavoured to shake the authority of the Apoſtles Creed, leaſt peradventure their ſmall authority, might not prevaile againſt all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, what they could not get effectuated by denying the letter, they laboured to performe by corrupting the ſenſe, and eſpecially of that article,<note place="margin">Short Cotech.

                  <hi>He deſcended into Hell.</hi> For in their new Catechiſmes, they interline, or put on the margent, this gloſſe with it. <hi>He deſcended into Hell</hi> that is. <hi>He continued in the ſtate of the dead, and vnder the power of Death, till the third day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Obſerved, that although we had, and ſaid the words of the Creed, before the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant began; yet we did not know the true ſenſe of it, in this and ſome other articles, albeit as S. Auguſtin shewes, it was made plaine &amp; short, that it might ſerve the capacity, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, &amp; memory of the ſimple. For there was a great quarrelling, before theſe greater
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43743:60"/> troubles, among ſome of the Miniſters, for the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>He deſcended into Hell.</hi> Some publickly taught, that they behoved to be literally vnderſtood, of a real and local deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: others of the preciſer ſort, called that a Papiſtical interpretation, againſt which, they did moſt sharply inveigh; and taught, according to Calvin, that the ſenſe of them was, that Chriſt did ſuffer in his Soule the horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned and forſaken man; which gloſſe was called by the former Miniſters, a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>To come then to the true ſenſe of this article, about which there was ſuch contrariety among the Miniſters, I had my recourſe to the holy Scriptures &amp; Fathers; and I found, that there was ſcarcely any article of our faith more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contain'd in the Scriptures, and more vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly avowed, by the holy Fathers, who brand thoſe, who do not believe it literally, with the name of Infidels. And laſtly I found, that diverſe groſſe wayes have been deviſed by the Miniſters, ſince their pretended Reformation, to pervert and obſcure it: and when the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood of one is diſcovered, they alwayes find out an other, but will never embrace the true ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>The light of reaſon doth shew to every Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien, that it is not ſufficient for mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, to hold the words of the Creed; but it is neceſſary alſo to follow the true ſenſe of it. This the holy Fathers do teach, who shew likwiſe, that, as Heretiques ever endeavoured to pervert
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43743:61"/> the true ſenſe of the Creed; ſo the true Church doth ever retaine &amp; maintaine it. S. Cyril, with the Alexandrin Synod, writes to this purpoſe to Neſtorius, Who pretended to believe the Nicen Creed, &amp; yet denyed the bleſſed Virgin to be the Mother of God.<note place="margin">Cyril. Alex. cum Syn. Alex. epiſt. <hi>10.</hi> ad Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. Aug. tom. <hi>3.</hi> de fide &amp; Symb c. <hi>1,</hi>

                  <hi>It's not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you profeſſe with vs the Symbol of faith &amp;c. For you do not vnderſtand, nor expound it rightly, but rather perverſly, although you Confeſſe the words of it with your tongue.</hi> S. Auguſtin alſo ſaith, to the like purpoſe. <hi>Vnder the few words contained in the Symbol, many Heretiques haue endeavoured to hide their poiſons, to whom the Divine mercy hath reſiſted, and doth reſiſt by ſpirituall men, who haue not only merited to believe and receive the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith, in theſe words; but alſo, by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God, to vnderſtand &amp; know it.</hi> So the Presbyterians, although they have denyed the Creed; yet vnder the words of it, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to hide their poiſons.</p>
               <p>Although the article of Chriſts deſcent to Hell, were not in the Creed (which is a clear and eaſy rule of faith, that ought to be plainly and literally vnderſtood) yet it is ſo clearly in the Scripture, that it cannot be denyed, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout wreſting of it.

                  </note> But let vs heare S.

For that prophecy, which ſaith: Thou wilt not leave my Soule in Hell cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted: which leaſt any man should preſume to vnderſtand otherwiſe, the ſame Peter doth expound it, in the Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> &amp;c. And then he concludes in theſe words: <hi>Quis ergo niſi infidelis &amp;c. Who them, except au Infidel, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt to haue been in Hell?</hi> Behold, what in S. Auguſtius iudgment, are all Presbyterians, who do contradict the prophecy, which, he ſaith, cannot be contradicted, and who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it in a contrary ſenſe; which S.

Which is indeed to goe againſt the Scriptures, both the old and new Teſtament, the Prophets and Apoſtles, the holy Fathers &amp; the whole Church; and, in a word, as S.

                  <hi>may, in all things, hold the Primacie.</hi> I know theſe things are laughed at, as if they were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, by the Presbyterians; who founds their faith vpon their owne groundleſſe fancies, and will believe nothing, which doth not ſuite to their humours, albeit it be moſt clearly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd in the Scriptures, ſo vnderſtood by the holy Fathers, and ſo believed by the Chriſtian world. But I intend God willing, to prefer theſe ſolid grounds to Puritanical imaginations, which are without, yea and againſt Scriptures the holy Fathers, and whole ancient Church, and laſtly againſt the clear words of the Creed.</p>
               <p>As I ſaw the true and clear ſenſe of this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; ſo I found, that the Miniſters haue vſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crooked windings &amp; turnings, to obſcure and deny the true ſenſe of it. For firſt; they haue
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43743:63"/> not ſtood to corrupt the letter of the Scripture. 2. they followed a ſenſe invented by Calvin, which was not only falſe, but by many eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd blaſphemous. 3. When for shame they had abandonned that ſenſe, the Presbyterians haue of late invented a new one, not ſo impious, but very ridiculous. And laſtly, to compleate the work, they haue denyed the whole Creed to be Apoſtolical; which is the cleanlieſt way that hath been yet vſed.</p>
               <p>For their corrupting of the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Beza, Calvins entire brother, may cary the prize. For, in the Bibles of his tranſlation, he turnes theſe words, 2. Acts 31. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell</hi> After this manner. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my body in the grave.</hi> And; when this manifeſt corruption of Gods word was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to him, by Proteſtants, he anſwers, in defence of his verſion, againſt Sebaſtian Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,<note place="margin">Beza cont.

                  </note> ſaying: <hi>No man can doubt, but here is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n't of the body &amp; grave, vnleſse one would be blind in the mid-day.</hi> This muſt be a ſtrange light, or rather a ſtrong illuſion, which the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians alone ſee. But the reaſon which Beza gives there a little before, for his changing; <hi>Soule</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> into <hi>graves</hi> is very remarkable. <hi>I did not this rashly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſince we ſee, that this place is chiefly wreſted by the Papiſts, for eſtablis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing their Limbe: and the ancients alſo, deviſed from it, the deſcent of Chriſts ſoule into hell.</hi> Our Presbyterians in Scotland, were one degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to Beza, for they did not corrupt two words, as he did, but only one, as may be ſeen
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43743:63"/> in the great bibles, printed at Edinburgh, by Andrew Hart; where they reade thus the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid text: <hi>Thow wilt not leave my Soule in the grave,</hi> putting grave for hell, which corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was amended in the new Tranſlations, that was made by order of King Iames, who ſaid in the conference at Hampton-Court, that he had never ſeen a true and ſincere tranſlation of the bible in English: but, of all theſe he had ſeen, that of Geneva was the worſt.</p>
               <p>Having thus corrupted the text, they did alſo invent corrupt ſenſes of it. Calvin the great Foundator of Presbytery, vnderſtands, by Chriſts deſcent to hell; that he ſuffered in his Soule the paines of a damned man, and that doubting of his Salvation, he vtteted words of deſperation. For thus he writes in his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Diros in anima cruciatus,</hi>

And yet Calvin eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m's ſo much this blaſphemous fancy, that he makes it the price of our Redemption. For thus he writes: <hi>Nothing had been done,</hi>

                  </note> ſaying, <hi>that Calvin wrote moſt truly, that nothing had been done, if Ieſus Chriſt had onely ſuffered a corporal death.</hi> Yea he calls this a doctrin moſt full of comfort. Theſe doctrines are ſo fals againſt the Scriptures, which shew nothing more frequently and clearly, then that we are redeemed by the blood and death of Chriſt; and they are in themſelues ſo abſurd and blaſphemous, that we neede ſpend no more time, in refutation of them: for they are of the ſame kind with thoſe, of which S. Hierome ſpeaks, when he ſaith. <hi>that to diſcover them, is to vanquish them.</hi> Yea ſome Ptoteſtants have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt them, as Doctor Bilſon B. of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter in his booke,<note place="margin">Bilſon in Apol.

But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the groſſe abſurdities of this ſenſe, invented by Calvin, yet it was generally follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by the Presbyterians, and by many other Proteſtants, who denyed the local deſcent of Chriſts ſoule to hell. For although it ſounded very ill; yet it behooved to be kep't by the Presbyterians, for want of a better, vntill a new one more commodious was found out, which now lately hath been performed by the new Reformers of theſe times, who ſee further and more clearly, then M.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43743:64"/> by God, to reforme the Church; yet did not ſo much as know his Catechiſme, nor the true ſenſe of the articles of his Creed; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſuch a ſenſe, as ſome of his diſciples haue abandonned it, as falſe; and others, as blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous.</p>
               <p>As Beza, in his verſion of the Scripture, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Hell</hi> into <hi>Grave;</hi> ſo he vnderſtood this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Creed, he deſcended into Hell: that is, He deſcended into the grave. Which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, together with the former coruption, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by M. Calvin, a learned Miniſter in Edinburgh, did publickly refute, in divers Sermons, a little before the troubles: for which he was much perſecuted by the Puritans. He shew that Bezas corruption made a groſſe Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology, in the Apoſtles Creed, or it made an explication more obſcure, then the thing it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. The Tautology would be very groſſe to ſay: <hi>Crucifyed, dead, and buryed, he deſcended into the grave;</hi> that would be twice buryed. Or if you make deſcending into hell, the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of burial, that is a rare Commentary, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate a matter, which is cleare and needs no Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary by that, which is more obſcure, and cannot yet be rightly vnderſtood by Proteſtants: as appeares by their diſſenſions. The ſame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter shew, that both theſe vices were againſt the end of the Creed, and the wiſdome of the holy Apoſtles, who made it short and plaine, that it might ſerve the capacity of all men: and therefore it was to be free of idle Tautologies, and obſcure Commentaries. But, at that time,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43743:65"/> this Miniſter did not know, that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were to deny the Creed, to haue been compoſed by the Apoſtles; by which his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are anſwered, although by falling into groſſer abſurdities.</p>
               <p>The third ſenſe deviſed by the Presbyterians, at Weſtminſter, is ſubiect to the like inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, that is: both of Tautologies, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure gloſſes. For they ſay, by that article, <hi>He deſcended into Hell,</hi> is vnderſtood, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ſtate of the dead, and vnder the power of death, till the third day. For firſt, it would be a Tautology to ſay dead and buryed, and then repeate againe he remained dead, or in the power of death: that is ſufficiently kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, by the words, that follow, to witt: The third day, he aroſe from the dead. For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to remaine dead ſo long as he was dead, and he was dead till the third day, that he aroſe from the dead. So, that the addition of <hi>he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into hell,</hi> vnderſtood in the Miniſters new coyned ſenſe, would not be onely ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, but alſo ridiculous. Then, if they will make Chriſts deſcent to hell, an explication of Chriſts remaining dead, the Commentary would be more obſcure then the text, which is clear of it ſelf. How would the Presbyterians be pleaſed, if one would ſay of Iohn Calvin, or Knox, or of their late Apoſtle M. Hender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they are dead, buryed, &amp; deſcended into hell? And if this man, being accuſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Presbytery, would bring, in his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne defence, the Miniſters new Commentary,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43743:65"/> that he meaned only by theſe words, that they remained in the power &amp; ſtate of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not as yet riſen from the dead. I am morally perſwaded, what ever Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary could be brought, either their owne or any other, the Presbyterians would be ill plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch a Text, and would thinke it was ſufficient to haue ſaid, that they were dead and buryed, without this addition. They deſcended into Hell.</p>
               <p>But, of all the expoſitions, that ever I found on this article, that of the late Proteſtant Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop Vsher, is the rareſt, which D. Vane ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Miniſters iuglings deſcribes thus.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>O what Serpentine wriglings and windings to eſcape the aſſaulters, do they make! O what perverſe, ridiculous and contradicting anſwers and evaſions do ſome of them make! In which they shew at once both much wit, and much folly. For fooles could not ſpeake, as they do; and wiſe men would not. In ſo much, that B. Vsher, Primat of Armagh, a very learned man, to avoid the Confeſsion of Chriſts deſcent into Hell, according to the article of the Creed, in the plaine ſenſe thereof, doth ſo turne it and wind it, that he makes the ſenſe of the words,</hi> He deſcended into hell, <hi>to be,</hi> He aſcended into Heaven. <hi>To ſuch pitifull refuges, doth the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kneſſe of a bad cauſe drive them &amp;c.</hi> Thus he. And ſo, by this Bishops Commentary, for <hi>deſcend</hi> we haue <hi>aſcend,</hi> and for <hi>Hell, Heaven.</hi> But all theſe ſenſes being nowayes ſatisfactory, the Presbyterians tooke the cleanlieſt &amp; eaſieſt way, to deny the Creed it ſelf, to be Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43743:66"/> that ſo men might not care much, or take great notice of the ſenſe, when all authority is taken from the text. That shift might, in ſome manner, ſerve their turne, if this truth were not, as expreſly in the Scripture, as it is in the Creed.</p>
               <p>Now, I would inquire at any man of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or ordinary diſcretion, who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider impartially theſe things, what I should do in this caſe? should I believe the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who haue no Scripture for them, in this point, but in expreſſe words, againſt them? should I give credit to thoſe, who, to maintaine their errour, did firſt manifeſtly corrupt the words of Scripture, with falſe tranſlations; and thereafter, did pervert the ſenſe of them, with blaſphemous interpretations? should I believe thoſe, who although they quitted their firſt ſenſe of blaſphemy, did invent another full of Tautology, not ſo impious, but very ridiculous. And who laſt of all, to compleate the worke, did deny their Creed? Or should I believe the old and new Teſtament, the Prophets foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the holy Apoſtles expounding? the holy Fathers ſo vnderſtanding, &amp; the whole primitive Church, aſſiſted by the Spirit of truth, ſo believing and profeſſing? And laſt of all, should I believe my Creed, which the whole Chriſtian world did receive, as a moſt perfect, plaine rule of faith, compoſed by the holy Apoſtles, for the capacity of all men? I muſt profeſſe, that, after ſuch a Triall, I could not put theſe authorityes, in the ballance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43743:66"/> much leſſe could I prefer the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians inconſtant, new opinion, to the ancient, conſtant beliefe of the whole world; vnleſſe, I would haue renounced both Reaſon &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

               <p>HAVING, by the Divine grace, &amp; by the former conſiderations, diſcovered, as well the falshood of the forſaid Presbyterian Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the ancient truth of the Catholique do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I was adviſed and much encouraged to make the like triall, of the principal points of our firſt Reformation: as concerning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, our iuſtification, &amp; the nature &amp; effect of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

                  </gap>t was repreſented vnto me, that there was no leſſe pretext of pure Scripture, and a like lowd cryes of a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyring light, for the laſt; then was for the firſt Reformation. And ſeing, by the former triall, I had diſcovered theſe, laſt pretences to be falſe: Why may not I haue ſome confidence to do the like, with the firſt, if I would vſe the l ke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence? And if the laſt Reformers haue been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and miſled by paſſion, why might not alſo their Predeceſſours over ſee themſelves too: Or what aſſurance can any man haue of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43743:67"/> their infallibility, more then of the others? The Alterations, that haue been lately made by the Presbyterians do shew (even in their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that their firſt Reformers were not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly aſſiſted. 2. I was put in mind, that I had found lately ſome of the moſt eminent among them, to be Corrupters, or as S. Paul ſpeakes Adulterers; both of the letter and ſenſe of the Scriptures: and therefore, they are not to be altogether truſted, without trial. In a word, great promiſes and aſſurances were made to me, that I would, by this triall, find out the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood of the firſt, as I had done of the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. &amp;, by that means I might attaine vnto the poſſeſſion of ſolid truth, whereon I might ſafely rely, for the good of my ſoule. As truth can endure iuſt trial, and deſires nothing more, by which it is more manifeſted; ſo falshood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide triall, but alwayes shuns it, becauſe thereby it's deceits are detected.</p>

Rom. q. <hi>12.</hi> Sa pientiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fime Maiores noſtri &amp;c.</note>Laſtly, it was showen vnto me that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Paſtours of the Church, did moſt wiſely reduce the whole ſubſtance of the Chriſtian doctrin, which is, of it ſelf, ſo large and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, into theſe 4. heads: to witt the Apoſtles Creed, the Sacraments, the Divine Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and our Lords prayer: for all things which belong either vnto the knowledge of God, the creation and governement of the world, or the Redemption of mankind, the rewards of the good or the punishments of the wicked, are contain'd in the Apoſtolique Creed. The ſignes and inſtruments, which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43743:67"/> God hath inſtituted for attaining grace, are the holy Sacraments. The divine Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, shew, what we ought to do; and our Lords prayer doth containe all, what we can wish or deſire. And therefore, theſe are (as it were) the foure great Pillars, wheron the whole fabricke of Chriſtianity relyes. Now it was told me, how I had found, by the former triall, that this laſt pretended Reformation, had overturned two of theſe Pillars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to witt the Apoſtles Creed, &amp; the Lords prayer; beſides the fundamental governement, eſtablished by Chriſt, in his Church. If then, I should find alſo, that the firſt Reformation had overturned the other two Pillars: to witt the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, &amp; the holy Sacraments: Then I might Conclude, that the end and intent of theſe Reformations (what ever was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reformers) hath been, vnder the pretence of Reformation, totall Deformation, and the deſtruction of the Chriſtian religion, and that, betwixt them, they haue compleated that hydeous worke of Deſolation. For, if the firſt refomation tooke away two, as the next hath taken away other two; Then they both together have ſubverted (ſo far as they could) the 4. great Pillars of Chriſtianity: and the laſt Presbyterian Reformation hath compleated, what the firſt had begun, and had not perfected.</p>
               <p>I begun then the trial of our firſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with it's doctrin, concerning the divine Commandements, and ſpecially of the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to keepe them: which was taught by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43743:68"/> our firſt, and is yet maintain'd by our laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers. For it was showen to me, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God were poſſible to be keept (as all wiſe and iuſt lawes are ordain'd for that end) that they may be obſerved; Then we, by teaching they were impoſſible to be keep't, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the very end, for which the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements were made, and ſo deſtroyed the Commadements themſelues.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the poſsibility, to keepe the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, with the aſsiſtance of Gods grace; denyed by the Presbyterians and their firſt Reformers,</head>
               <p>I had for ſome ſpace, a preiudicate opinion, in this matter, againſt the Catholique doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, which affirmed, as the Miniſters taught, that it was poſſible for any man to keep all the divine Commandements; yea and to do more then God had commanded. I conceived that to be falſe. For, ſince no man, to my knowlege, or their owne confeſſion, had kep't them all, or doth keep them; I thought it not poſſible they could keep them. For it would ſeeme, if a thing were poſſible, ſome one, among ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, would put it in act. Vpon the other part, I was not well ſatisfyed with our owne doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which teacheth, that it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep the Commandements of God:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43743:68"/> by reaſon of a dangerous conſequence, which a Catholique made me ſee to follow thervpon, to witt: That ſo many thouſands should be damned for not doing that, which was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible for them to do. I wondered how that could ſtand with the goodneſſe &amp; iuſtice of God. For greater Tyranny &amp; iniuſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined, then to punish one with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery and grievous paines, for not doing that, which was altogether impoſſible for him to do. The light of Nature would not permit me, to impute ſuch cruelty to God, whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; mercy I knew to be vnſpeakable.</p>
               <p>Hauing therefore ſeriouſly implored the Divine aſſiſtance, that I might come to the knowledge of the truth, I received the firſt ſparke of light, in this matter, by knowing the true ſtate of the queſtion. For I found that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Catholiques did not teach, that men were able of themſelves, that is by their owne ſtrenth, or by any natural power, to keep the Divine Commandements; but only they teach, that men are able to keep them, by the aſſiſtance of Gods grace Now that particle of divine grace, was ordinarly ſuppres't by the Miniſters, in this queſtion. And, when I knew this to be the true meaning and expreſſe doctrin of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, as may be ſeen,<note place="margin">Large Catech. Vveſt. after the C m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> in the Councel of Trent, ſeſſion 6. Canon 18. I imagined there was no real Controverſy, till I found, in the new Presbyterian Catechiſme, a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception made againſt Gods grace. For, hauing there made this queſtion: <hi>Is any man able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43743:69"/> to keep the Commandements of God?</hi> They anſwer: <hi>No man is able, either of himſelf, or by any Grace received in this life, perfectly to keep the Commandements of God: but doth dayly break them, in thought, word &amp; deed.</hi> And, in the anſwer to the third queſtion thereafter, They ſay, <hi>that every ſin, even the leaſt, deſerveth Gods wrath and curſe, both in this life, and that, which is to come.</hi> This booke is very obſcure, in moſt points; but here it ſpeaks ſomewhat clearly: although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, by foyſting in the word, <hi>perfectly,</hi> it ſeemes to caſt a miſt over our ey's, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of it, may lurke in their obſcurities, as we shall ſee hereafter. I found the Catholique doctrin to be contrary, ſet down in theſe termes, by the Councel of Trent:<note place="margin">Conſil. Trid. ſeſſ. <hi>6.</hi> can. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>If any man ſay, that the Commandements of God are impoſſible to be kep't, by a man even iuſtifyed, and conſtituted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace, let him be accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being therefore deſirous, to know the truth, I began firſt to conſider the teſtimonies of Scripture, for the ſtrenth of Gods grace, to enable men to keep his Commandements; which teſtimonies I found to be very ſtrong and expreſſe. 1. I ſaw that God promisheth cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, in the Scriptures, to enable men to keep his Commandements, yea and to make them actually keep them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.27.</note> God ſaith in Ezechiel: <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe yow to walk in my ſtatutes, and you shall keep my Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37. <hi>v.</hi> 23.24.</note> 
                  <hi>and do them.</hi> And againe he ſaith: <hi>They shall be my people, and I will be their God, and David my ſervant shall be King over them &amp;c.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43743:69"/> they shall alſo walk in my iudgments, keep my Commandements and do them.</hi> Where nothing is more clear, then that God hath promiſed, to enable men to keep his Commandements. But Gods promiſes are true, for he is faitfull,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21.</note> (as Abraham the Father of the faithfull did profeſſe &amp; believe) and whatſoever he hath promiſed he is able and willing to perform. Therefore his promiſes, which are ever true, haue been truly &amp; faithfull fulfilled: And ſo conſequently ſome, by the help of Gods grace, haue actually kept his Commendements. Therefore they are not impoſſible, but poſſible to be kept by the grace, which God giveth in this life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I found, in the Scriptures, a real performance of this promiſe; for ſome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded there by name, to haue actually kept the Commandements of God. S. Luke giveth this excellent teſtimony of Zachary &amp; Elyza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, the parents of S. Iohn Baptiſt:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>They were both iuſt before God, walking in all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements &amp; ordinances or,</hi> (as it is in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique tranſlation) <hi>the iuſtifications of our Lord, blameleſſe.</hi> So that they were not only iuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, but alſo before God, and they did not only walk in one, but in all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, without blame.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.22.24.4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Iob. ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo calls Noe, a iuſt and a perfect man.

Iob is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in the Scriptures, a perfect &amp; vpright man, one that feared God, &amp; eſchewed evil.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43743:70"/> But moſt clearly is the iuſtice of Abraham exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the mouth of God himſelf, who ſaid to his Son Iſaac:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 26.3.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>I will perform the oath, which I ſware vnto Abraham thy father &amp;c. In thy ſeed, shall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed. Becauſe that Abraham obeyed my voice, &amp; kept my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, my Commandements, my Ceremonies, &amp; my lawes.</hi> What can be more clear, to prove the poſſibility of keeping Gods Commandements, with the help of his grace: and to diſprove the impoſſibility of obſerving them. For what is impoſſible to be done by men, even with the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, no man hath done, or will do. But God himſelf and the Scriptures shew, that divers haue kept Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore with the help of his grace, they are poſſible &amp; not impoſſible to be kept. Yea, it appeared moſt conſonant vnto all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; piety, that, if the Commandements were poſſible, and were actually kept, by Gods grace, in the law of Nature, &amp; under the law of Moyſes, they should be more poſſible, and more eaſy to be kept, vnder the law of Grace: when, by the fulneſſe of Chriſts Redemption, Grace is more plentifully powred forth, and in which time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.26.</note> the Prophet Eſay foretells that the light of the Moon, should be as the light of the Sun, &amp; the light of the Sun should be ſevenfold, &amp; as the light of seven dayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I found the Scripture to be ſo far from affirming the Commandements of God to be impoſſible; that they avow the clear contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea, and more then the contrary. For a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43743:70"/> thing to be impoſſible, is much more, then to be hard or difficult. What is impoſſible to men, cannot be done by any man: what is hard &amp; not impoſſible, may be done, although with difficulty. Now the Scriptures affirmes, that the Commandements of God are eaſy, which is not ſo much as difficult, and therefore much leſſe are they impoſſible. Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 11.29.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Take my yoke vpon you &amp;c. For my yoke is eaſy &amp; my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is light.</hi> And S.

                  <hi>he knoweth God &amp; keepeth not his Commandements, is a liar, &amp; truth is not in him.</hi> What is eaſy, light &amp; not heavy, is neither hard, heavy nor impoſſible. But the Commandements of God are an eaſy yoke, a light burden, &amp; they are not heavy, as our Saviour &amp; his beloved Diſciple do affirme. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, they are not hard, nor heavy, and much leſſe are they impoſſible. Yea, I found it was the love of God, that made the Commandements, which ſeeme ſo hard and difficult to others, to be eaſy vnto the Saints. David ſaith,<note place="margin">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43743:71"/> Commandements.</hi> Therefore, hauing diligently conſidered theſe teſtimonies of the Scripture, I found, that the Scripture was clearly for the poſſibility of keeping Gods Commandements, with the aſſiſtance of his grace, as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques teach; and againſt the impoſſibility of obſerving them, as the Prerbyterians &amp; almoſt all Proteſtants hold. Wherevpon, I tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to admire at two things. Firſt: how it was poſſible, that all the points of our religion are expreſsly in Scripture; and that the contrary points, maintain'd by the Papiſts, are not in Scripture; but condemned by it: ſince, vpon ſerious triall, I found the Scripture to be, in this matter, ſo clearly againſt vs. 2. I did no leſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, that I, reading frequently the Scriptures before this ſearch, did not, till now, obſerve our doctrin to be contrary vnto it. But a Catholique to whom I imparted my thoughts, ſome ſpace thereafter, did quickly free me of theſe admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by shewing me the reaſons of both. The firſt, ſaid he, is not to be much admired. For if the firſt Reformers had not pretended, that all their new doctrines were expreſsly in the Scriptures, they had got no followers: and, if the Miniſters, did not continue to make the ſame pretence, there would be few or none, ſo foolish, as to abide with them. This ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Scripture all Heretiques have ever made, although their errours were clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scripture: And this pretence they muſt all make, if they intend to find any Credit. The reaſon alſo of the ſecond, ſaid he, is no leſſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43743:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> evident: For it's no wonder that, till of late, yow did not find your doctrin to be contrary vnto the Scriptures: becauſe you did reade them before, very ſuperficially, without ſolid reflexion &amp; attention, as the moſt part of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do, and many alſo reade them with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate opinions, framing their faith vnto the Scripture, but wreſting the Scripture vnto their errours. That is not to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to which our Saviour did exhort the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, who contented themſelves with the like ſuperficiall reading of them; and therefore could find nothing of Chriſt in them. But he shew, if they would ſearch; that is, reade di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently &amp; conſideratly, they would find, that the Scriptures bare teſtimony of him. The like may be ſaid truly of the Catholique Church &amp; Religion: that, if the Proteſtants would ſearch the Scriptures, they would find therein ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and clear teſtimonies of them. Thus ſpake the Catholique.</p>
               <p>But although the above cited teſtimonies of the Scripture, appeared ſufficiently clear vnto me; yet, leaſt relying vpon my own iudgment, I might be deceived: I had my next recours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Scriptures, to the expoſition of the holy Fathers, &amp; to the beliefe of the holy Primitive Church. From which, the old Epiſcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did affirm, that the Papiſts were altogether degenerated, and we were made by them to believe, that as our doctrin was conform to the Scriptures, ſo it was alſo conforme to the holy Fathers, who were all ſaid to be of our
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43743:72"/> religion, true Proteſtants. But to ſpeak mildly whithout any exaggeration, I found that to be a groſſe vntruth, and that the Puritans, who either not claime the holy Fathers, or yeeld them vnto the Papiſts, are much more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous in this matter, then the old Proteſtants, as shall be ſeen God willing, in the progreſſe of this Triall.</p>
               <p>Concerning the poſſibility of keeping the divine Commandements, I found three things to be clearly contayned in the holy Fathers. 1. They affirm that the Catholique doctrin is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Scriptures, which they did ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and expound. 2. They prove it by the light of reaſon, drawen from the nature, iuſtice, &amp; goodneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For either a man doth not love and then the command is heavy; or elſe he doth love, and then it cannot be heavy.</hi> In which words, divers notable things are contayn'd. I took notice principally of theſe. 1. That he ſaith,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43743:73"/> the poſſibility of keeping the Commandements is moſt firmely believed. 2. he doth not only prove it by Scriptures, but alſo by the nature of God; that he, who is iuſt &amp; good, could not command things impoſſible. 3. That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God are heavy to thoſe, who want the love of God; but they are light to thoſe who haue it. Yea, the ſame holy Doctour shewes, by the teſtimony of S. Paul, that Chriſt came into the world, and lay'd down his life, for this end; that he might obtaine grace vnto vs, whereby we might be enabled to keep the Commandements of God, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo hard &amp; difficult.<note place="margin">

Behold there the Catholique doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, affirmed by the holy Fathers, not of their own heads, but proved by the Scriptures. And
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43743:73"/> that this was the general beliefe of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; of the ancient Church, it was made appeare vnto me, by the ſecond Arauſican Councel, celebrated about S. Auguſtins time,<note place="margin">Arauſ. Concil. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </note> which makes this profeſſion: <hi>We believe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Catholique faith, that by grace received in baptiſme, all ſuch as are baptized, Chriſt helping &amp; cooperating, may and ought to fulfill, if they will labour faithfully, theſe things that belong to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> So it is evident, that the holy Fathers &amp; ancient Church, believed this doctrin to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Scriptures: which is ſufficient for my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>This ſame truth is confirmed by S. Auguſtin, not only by the Scriptures, but alſo by reaſon. <hi>Some one may ſay,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>I can by no means love my enemies.</hi> To which he anſwer's thus. <hi>God ſaith to thee</hi> in all the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Aug. ſerm. <hi>61.</hi> de temp.</note> 
                  <hi>that thou canſt. Conſider now whether thou or God ought to be believed: and therefore, ſince truth cannot lie, let humane weakneſſe forbeare it's vaine excuſes. For he, who is iuſt, could not command any thing that's impoſſible: and he, who is good, will never condemne man for that, which he could not avoid.</hi> So that, according to S. Auguſtin, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians beliefe is not only againſt all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, although they pretend to believe nothing beſide Scriptures: but alſo againſt ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: that is, againſt both the iuſtice &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God.<note place="margin">Hieron. epiſt. ad Celant.</note> S. Hierome alſo affirmeth that theſe, who ſay, that God hath commanded any thing impoſſible, pronounce God to be vniuſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ſame two moſt renowned &amp;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43743:74"/> holy Fathers do not only teach the Catholique doctrin; but alſo they cenſure the contrary, that is the Presbyterians opinion, as blaſphemy, in the Heretiques of their time. <hi>We accurſe,</hi> ſaith S.

                  <hi>their blaſphemy, that affirm God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any thing impoſſible to man; and that Gods Commandements cannot be kept of any man in particular, but of all men taken together.</hi> The ſame is repeated by S. Hierome. So that theſe holy Fathers do iudge this errour not only to be an hereſy, but alſo a blaſphemy. And yet theſe new Reformers (which is a thing moſt admirable &amp; deplorable) make ſuch blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the principall articles of their faith: and they haue alſo moſt tyrannically enforced others, vnder pretext of giving them only pure Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſwear &amp; believe ſuch horrible errours and blaſphemies, for divine truths. But I found that ſome more prudent and conſcientious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, haue abandoned this wicked Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall opinion, yea and condemned it, as the holy Fathers had done, for blaſphemy.

                  </note> what the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians do eſteeme a principal article of their faith, how a learned Proteſtant, (whoſe booke came forth in the yeare 1635. with great applauſe in Cambridge) and King Iames (who was head of the Church of England) do condemne as blaſphemy &amp; impiety, &amp; a giving the lie to God. I heare alſo, that ſome of the new Independent Congregations in England, do no leſſe sharply condemn the ſame Presbyterian opinion.</p>
               <p>But, beſides all theſe preſſing authorities, I found alſo ſome convincing reaſons againſt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians; which I will briefly collect. 1. It cannot ſtand with the goodneſſe and juſtice of a lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſuch as God is, to impoſe vpon people lawes, which are impoſſible to be kept, &amp; then to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with loſſe of goods and life, for not obſerving theſe impoſſible lawes. The greateſt Tyrant on earth did never arrive to that hight of impiety &amp; cruelty. Therefore it is impoſſible, that God, who is good &amp; iuſt, should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch cruelty &amp; iniuſtice. To this accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth S. Auguſtin, in his words above cited when he ſaith.<note place="margin">Aug. ſer. <hi>61.</hi> de temp.</note> 
                  <hi>God could not command any thing impoſſible, becauſe he is iuſt, neither will he dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne a man for that, which he could not avoid, becauſe he is mercyfull.</hi> Yea theſe abſurdities of iniuſtice and cruelty would follow, againſt the goodneſſe of God, in a high degree; in how much the punishment he inflicts is greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:43743:75"/> then can be inflicted by man, although th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> greateſt Tyrant on earth. For what is the lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of temporall goods and life, in compariſon of the loſſe of heaven, and of the death both of Soule &amp; body, in the eternal paines of Hell? Therefore it's no wonder, that the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; ſome Proteſtants do deteſt the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian doctrin, as extream blaſphemy. 2. It doth not only incroach vpon the goodneſſe &amp; iuſtice of God; but alſo vpon his wiſdome. For as it's certaine, that God made theſe lawes; ſo it's no leſſe evident in the Scriptures, that God vſeth admonitions &amp; exhortations, propounds rewards and threatens punishements, to induce men to obſerve his lawes. Now what Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate would be eſteemed to be in his right wits, who would not only make lawes impoſſible to be kept, but alſo ſpend time in making exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; propounding rewards, to perſwade men, to do impoſſibilities? But the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian doctrine makes God, who is not only wiſe, but wiſdome it ſelf, ſubiect to both theſe follies, which are moſt groſſe abſurdities. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince his lawes, admonitions, &amp; exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations cannot be but prudent &amp; reaſonable: they do ever ſuppoſe the poſſibility of that, which they enioyne, and wherevnto they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte. 3. The Presbyterian doctrine is not only iniurious to God, but alſo it is very preiudiciall to man: for it would rob him of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all vertues, to witt, the love of God. For none can love another, vnleſſe he be good &amp; iuſt, or at leaſt appeare to be ſo. But how
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43743:75"/> can God appeare to be ſo, who is deſcribed by the Presbyterians, as if he were the moſt cruel Tyrant in the world, to command impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; then to punish man eternally for not doing them? Therefore, if the Prerbyterian doctrine were true, no man could love God, as good &amp; gratious: but rather would hate him, as vniuſt &amp; Tyrannous. 4. The Presbyterian opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is a great enemy to piety, &amp; vertue. For, if the Commandements be impoſſible, none will ſtrive to keep them: and, by this meanes, a wide gate is opened to all impiety. This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, by the forementioned Miniſter M. Shelford, who ſaith: <hi>Were the law impoſsible to be kept, then all the exhortations, &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in Gods word should be idle: then all mens labours would wax lazie, &amp; then, good life, which is after the rule, would be exiled: for that no man will ſtrive againſt the ſtream. Wherefore, great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are they to Chriſtian growth, &amp; reward in the way of Godlineſſe, who are againſt this doctrine,</hi> to witt, of the poſſibility to keep the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Laſtly, if the law were impoſſible, then all men would be freed from ſubiection &amp; obedience to it: for who can be reaſonably tyed to things meerly impoſſible? And this was the vſe, that Iſlebius, one of Luthers Schollers, made of his doctrine; wherevpon he began the ſect of the Anti-nomians: as Sleidan doth teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy in the 12. book of his hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Having therefore found ſuch clear teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scriptures &amp; Fathers, &amp; ſuch weight of right reaſon, for the ancient Catholique do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43743:76"/> I could not, either in reaſon, or conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, reiect all theſe, and follow the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians groundleſſe fancies, which are againſt the very ground of faith, to witt, the holy Scriptures. For the Presbyterians do teach, that the commandements are impoſſible, even with Gods grace; And the Scripture ſaith they are eaſy, light &amp; not heavy, which is more then if it had affirmed, that they were meerly poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Againe, the Presbyterians, by affirming the commandements are impoſſible, do averre that never any did keep them, doth, or shall keep them. The Scripture shewes, in expreſſe termes, that Abraham, Zachary &amp; Elizabeth, and others did keep them, and that God hath promiſed many should keep them. S. Iohn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth: that he who ſaith, he knoweth God &amp; keepeth not his commandements, is a liar, &amp; the truth is not in him. The Presbyterians do profeſſe, that they know God, and that they neither do, nor can keep his commandments; and yet they will not be eſteemed liars, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true Profeſſours. For my part, I am not able to reconcile ſuch manifeſt contradictions, as are in this matter, betwixt the Scriptures &amp; the Presbyterians. And therefore, ſeing I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not adhere to both, I chooſed rather to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Presbyterians, in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> A Conſideration of the Presbyterians principall grounds, againſt the Poſsibility, of keeping the Divine Commandements.</head>
               <p>HAVING received aboundant ſatifaction, in this matter, concerning the Catholique doctrin, I will briefly run through the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians principal grounds againſt it; which in this ſearch, I did not leave vnconſidered. 1. I found they acknowledged the Novelty of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. 2. They brought no pure Scripture to prove it; notwithſtanding they pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, but Scripture. 3. The Scriptures they bring, are privatly expounded by them, againſt the holy Fathers &amp; ancient Church, &amp; againſt the Scriptures themſelves, in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 4. They lay down ſome falſe Maximes and weak reaſons, whereon they build their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary faith, or rather moſt dangerous errour.</p>
               <p>Calvin acknowledges the novelty &amp; ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his doctrine,<note place="margin">Cal. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Inſtit, cap. <hi>7,</hi> ſect. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> in theſe words. <hi>That we ſaid the obſervation of the law to be impoſsible, is briefly to be explained &amp; confirmed, for it was wont commonly to be eſteemed, a moſt abſurd opinion; in ſo much as Hierome did not doubt to denounce a curſe to it; but I care nothing what Hierome thought.</hi>

                     </gap>. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> The Centuriators alſo of Magdeburg do acknowledge the ſame, that the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, as S. Iuſtin Martyr, Tertullian,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43743:77"/> S. Cyprian &amp; many more did affirme, that the law was poſſible to be kept. This Confeſſion of Calvin &amp; the Centuriſts, did manifeſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vnto me the antiquity of this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique doctrine; &amp; that it was no late invention of the Popes, as the Miniſters were wont to pretend falſly of the whole Catholique religion.</p>
               <p>Then for Scripture, they cannot bring ſo much as one place, which containeth expreſly the article of their beliefe, to witt: That the Commandements are impoſſible to be kept, even with all the grace that Goh gives in this life. Calvin brings theſe words of our Saviour.<note place="margin">Cal lib. <hi>2.</hi> Inſtit. cap. <hi>8.</hi> ſect. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſtrenth &amp;c.</hi> Wherevpon he &amp; his followers do ſcance, after this manner. To love God with all our heart, requires all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of out Soule, to be alwayes applyed vnto the love of God, which none can do. From which they inferre, that we are ſo far from being able to keep all the Commandments, that we cannot ſo much as keep the firſt. In anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to which, a Catholique shew me, that he did acknowledge the words of Scripture; but that Calvins private interpretation &amp; inference vpon them, is no Scripture. 2. he ſaid, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids that Calvins gloſſes &amp; conſequences were no Scripture, they were not to be much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; ſince they were againſt the holy Fathers, who will be prefer'd to him, in the iudgment of all wiſe men. 3. They are leſſe to be regarded, or rather much to be deteſted, ſeing they are expreſly againſt the Scriptures themſelves, in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43743:78"/> other places. For Calvin ſaith, that none can love God with all his heart; and David ſaith in the Scripture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.10.</note> ſpeaking to God. <hi>I haue ſought thee in my whole heart.</hi> And God himſelf appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves this teſtimony to be true, when he gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Prophet to ſay to Ieroboam:<note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 14.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt not been, as my ſervant David: who kept my Commandements and followed me with his whole heart.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 23.25.</note> The Scripture ſaith alſo of Ioſias That, <hi>he turned vnto the Lord in all his heart, in all his Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and in all his might, according to all the law of Moyſes.</hi> Therefore it's falſe againſt Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res themſelves, what Calvin ſaith; that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any to love God with all his heart, and conſequently, his interpretation of the love of God,<note place="margin">Shel. p. <hi>142.</hi>
                  </note> is alſo falſe. M. Shelford a Proteſtant Miniſter ſaith, we love God with all our heart, when we preferre him above all the world, and above our lives, as the Martyrs did: when we will not offend God, not part from his love, for the love or feare of no Creature. This is the love of God with all our heart, which is here commanded, wherevnto we are obliged, &amp; which by Gods grace, may be by vs fulfilled, as it was done by Abraham, Zachary &amp; Elyza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth. For how could the Scripture ſay, that they kept all the Commandements, &amp; walked in them blameleſſe; if they had not kept the firſt &amp; greateſt of all the Commandements? The abſolute &amp; higheſt perfection of loving God, is neither commanded nor can be exerciſed in this life, but can only be attayn'd to in the heavens; where the fulfilling of it (as S. Auguſtin ſpeaks)
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43743:78"/> is not obedience, but happineſſe. Thus ſpake the Catholique with more words, whereby I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved good ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Presbyterians pretend, it is impoſſible to keep this other Commandment: <hi>Thou shall not covet.</hi> Becauſe they ſay that here is forbidden all motion of concupiſcence, although invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, &amp; albeit we reſiſt vnto it: Whereof no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in this life can be free.<note place="margin">Shel. p. <hi>143.</hi>
                  </note> To which I find the ſame M. Shelford anſwer, ſaying; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the will is only forbidden here, &amp; the cherishing of the firſt motion to ſin, according to the Scripture every where:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12.</note> 
                  <hi>let not ſin reigne in your mortel bodies</hi> and, <hi>Go not after thy concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences to fulfill the luſts therof.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>14.</hi> Aug. ad Iulian. lib. <hi>2.</hi> prope fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> Touching which matter, S. Auguſtin ſaith moſt clearly: <hi>As for vs we would ever be without ſin, till this evil</hi> (of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence) <hi>were healed, if we did not conſent vnto it to evil.</hi> Therefore, not to conſent vnto concupiſcence, is no ſin, and by the grace of God we may not conſent; and therefore we may keep that Commandment. <hi>Thou shalt not Covet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They bring theſe words of S. Iohn.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Prover.</hi> 24.16.</note> 
                  <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves &amp; the truth is not in vs.</hi> Moreover, Salomon ſaith <hi>the iuſt man falls</hi> 7. <hi>times a day.</hi> From which they inferre, that it is impoſſible to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendemens ſo much as one day. I remember that a Catholique anſwered me, obiecting theſe places to him againſt the poſſibility of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and ſaid: that there was this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Catholiques &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43743:79"/> that the Proteſtants make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to contradict it ſelf, neither haue they any probable way, nor care they much how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe contradictions, but think it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to lay hold on that, which they imagine makes for them. As here, becauſe. S. Iohn ſaith: if we ſay, that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, they conclude that it's impoſſible to keep the Commandments, whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shewes that Abraham, Zachary &amp; Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth kept the Commandments, and therefore they make the Scripture ſay as much, as if it ſaid they kept the Commandments, &amp; they kept not the Commandments, which are flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions. But Catholiques clearly shew, that one may keep the Commandments, as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham &amp; others did, &amp; yet not be free of ſin: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture affirmeth both. Theſe two truths are not contrary one to another, as the Presbyterians do imagine. For one doth keep the Commandments, who doth nothing againſt charity, or the love of God, which is the end of the Commandments, as S. Paul affirmes: and that only is properly a breach of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, which breaketh love &amp; friendship with God. But that is only done by mortal or grievous ſins, &amp; not by light or venial faults, ſuch as an idle inoffenſive word, a little immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate laughter,<note place="margin">Aug. de nat. &amp; gra cap. <hi>38.</hi>
                  </note> &amp; ſuch like, as S. Auguſtin reckons out, in his booke of Nature and grace. For ſuch lights faults do not break friendship with God, ſince they do it not reaſonably with men. Now, by the grace of God, men may be free of mortal ſins, although not of venial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43743:79"/> &amp; therefore they may keep the Commandments, &amp; yet not be free of ſin. This truth is clearly delivered by S. Auguſtin.<note place="margin">Aug. ſerm. <hi>56.</hi> de temp.</note> 
                  <hi>As no man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ever hath been, or ever shall be without ſmall offences; ſo we, by Gods help &amp; aid, may and ought to be without any manner of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital crimes.</hi> And again he shewes, that, albeit Zachary kept all the Commandments, yet he was not without ſin: for being a Prieſt he was to offer vp Sacrifice, not only for the ſins of others, but alſo for his own ſins, as S. Paul affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: whereas Chriſt Ieſus was the only prieſt, who being free of all ſin, did offer vp Sacrifice only, for the ſins of others. Et elſwhere he ſaith: <hi>Becauſe ſin doth often ſteal vpon vs in light matters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Id. lib. de nat. &amp; gr. cap. <hi>38.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>&amp; ſometimes vnawares, they were both iuſt and not without ſin.</hi> So that by the diſtinction of mortal &amp; venial ſin (which is ſufficiently expreſſed by our Saviour, when he ſaid:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 5.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of Iudgment. Who shall ſay Raca, shall be in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of a Councel. And who shall ſay, Thou foole, shall be guilty of Hell-fire.</hi> Which is alſo clearly contain'd, in the holy Fathers, and is conſonant to right reaſon) theſe places of Scripture, which shew that ſome kept the Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dments, &amp; the others which teach, that the iuſt are not alwayes without ſin, are both true, &amp; eaſily reconciled. But the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians quite the firſt, and to maintaine their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, adhere only to the laſt, which they alſo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly expound, againſt the ſenſe of the holy Fathers, &amp; the very words of the other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>After theſe Principal Scriptures, which they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43743:80"/> bring,<note place="margin">Luth. tom. <hi>1.</hi> fol. <hi>196.</hi> Cal. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Inſtit. c. <hi>14.</hi> ſect. <hi>9.</hi> Shel. p. <hi>146.</hi>
                  </note> I conſidered next their chiefe Maximes &amp; reaſons. Luther &amp; Calvin do teach, that all the beſt actions, even of the greateſt Saints, are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſins: and the Presbyterians do generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the ſame doctrine. From which indeed it followes very clearly, if it were true, that the Commandments are impoſſible to be kept. I will bring a Proteſtant Miniſter giving his Iudgmens of this doctrine, which was taught by his two firſt Apoſtles. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, ſaith M. Shelford in his foreſaid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that the very beſt works of the Saints are vnclean, impure, menſtruous &amp; mortall ſins; therefore it is impoſſible, for any man, to keep the law. I anſwer, ſaith he, They that ſay ſo, cannot in my iudgment, <hi>be excuſed from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream blaſphemy:</hi> Yet, ſeeing it is out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they may happily obtaine pardon, as the Iews did, who crucifyed our Saviour. Can the works &amp; the fruits of the holy Ghoſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure? Hath Chriſt purchaſed to himſelf no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a filthy &amp; impure generation, which can do nothing but ſin, and that mortally? How can this but derogate from the grace &amp; wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God? from grace, that it cannot purify the heart from filthineſſe: from his wiſdome &amp; iuſtice, to reward menſtruous rags (for ſo they term them) with heaven? Thus he. So that in his iudgemens, this maxime of M. Luther &amp; Calvin, is not only falſe but alſo blaſphemous againſt the merits of Chriſt, &amp; the power of his grace.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> It is likwiſe clearly againſt the Scripture. For S. Paul ſaith: <hi>If a Virgin marry, she ſinneth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43743:80"/> not:</hi> but if we believe the Presbyterians, she ſinneth, whether she marie or marie not. Chriſt ſaith of S, Mary Magdalene:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc. c.</hi> 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>she hath wrought a good work on me.</hi> But if theſe men ſpeak true, she wrought an evill work. In a word: I found their words to be againſt Chriſts words, and the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>I found alſo that their reaſons were very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolid, as for example when they ſay: none doth keep the Commandments; therefore none can keep them. For although the antecedent were true, the conſequence is very falſe. And it is iuſt as you would ſay, Adam did not keept Gods Commandment in paradiſe; Therefore he was not able by Gods grace to keep it: Which is moſt ridiculous &amp; a falſe kinde of reaſoning; for we can do many things, with the help of Gods grace, which we do not. S. Hierome clears this matter, when writing againſt the Pelagians he ſaith: <hi>God hath commanded things poſsible,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hier. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cont Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag. c. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of this no man doubts: but becauſe men do not theſe things that are poſsible; therefore all the world hath need of the mercy of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, when expreſſe Scripture is produced, shewing, that diverſe haue actually kept the Commandments; I haue heard ſome Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſay, that no ſuch men are living now a dayes. This they do, iudging all men by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Of ſuch perſons S. Hierome ſaith:<note place="margin">Hier. in cap. <hi>5.</hi> Math.</note> 
                  <hi>Many iudging the Commandments of God by their own weakneſſe, &amp; not by the ſtrenth of the Saints, think all the Commandment; of God to be impoſsible.</hi> But if diverſe kept the Commandments in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43743:81"/> law of nature, &amp; vnder the law of Moyſes; how much more may it be iuſtly thought, that many haue kept them in the law of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the law of the Spirit reigneth, &amp; when the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves of the love of God, as the death &amp; paſſion of Chriſt, and the like, are much more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then they were before his coming: when theſe things were knowen, but very obſcurely? At leaſt this confeſſion of theirs, (to witt that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe are recorded in the Scriptures to haue kept the Commandments) shewes, that they are not abſolutly impoſſible.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe (as would ſeeme) the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, being preſſed alſo with the waight of other reaſons, haue begun to ſay of late: that the Commandments are not abſolutly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but only that they are impoſſible to be kept <hi>perfectly.</hi> But this being an ambiguous expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp; very apt to deceive; I was deſirous to know, in what ſenſe it was true, &amp; in what not; and in what ſenſe the Presbyterians intend it. Wherevpon a Catholique, who did much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me in this triall, shew me: that in this matter concerning the obſervation of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there may be diſtinguished two kinds of perfection, to wit: perfection in <hi>parts,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in <hi>degrees.</hi> The firſt is, when one having the love of God; endeavoureth to keep not a part only, but the whole law of God; as Ioſias did, who turned vnto God, according to all the law of Moyſes To this perfection, all men are obliged: for he, who offends in one, is guilty of all, as S. Iames teacheth. And as all are obliged to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43743:81"/> this perfection of keeping the whole law; ſo by Gods grace, they may perform it. Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in degrees is, when the commandments are kept in the higheſt degree of perfection; as the Angels and Saints in heaven do love &amp; obey God, moſt perfectly. Now, as the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot be kept here in this life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that higheſt degree of perfection; ſo neither are they required to be kept ſo perfectly of vs. But they may be kept in an inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection, which God doth iuſtly exact of vs. For clearing of which matter, the ſame Catholique shew me, that there are three ſtates of perfection containd in Scripture. 1. They are called perfect, who alwayes actually love God, and refer all actually to his glory. This ſtate of perfection, is only proper to the bleſſed Saints in heaven; &amp; as it cannot be attaind to in this life; ſo neither is it commanded. Of this perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, S, Paul ſpeaks, when he ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Et ver.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Not that I haue now received, or now am perfect; but I purſue, if I may comprehend.</hi> And yet, immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly thereafter, he calleth himſelf and others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in another inferiour degree of perfection. <hi>Let vs therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as many as are perfect, be thus minded.</hi> 2. They are called perfect, who, although they do not alwayes actually love God, &amp; think vpon him; yet they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate themſelves totally to Gods ſervice, and leave willingly all worldly things, to pleaſe him; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>If thou wilt be</hi> perfect, <hi>go and ſell all thow haſt, &amp; give to the poore &amp;c.</hi> This perfection is not commanded, but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43743:82"/> onely counſelled, as the holy Fathers conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly teach; and albeit it be not commanded; yet many, by Gods grace, do attayne vnto it. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly, they are called perfect, who are ready to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſake &amp; looſe all, before they looſe the love &amp; friendship of God. This laſt kind of perfection is required of all men: as God ſaid to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Math.</hi> 5. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>walk before me and be thou perfect:</hi> and Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples: <hi>be ye perfect.</hi> The Sripture calls ſome perfect in this ſenſe, for it ſaith, that <hi>Noe was a iuſt and a perfect man;</hi> And S. Paul ſaith, <hi>we ſpeak wiſdome among the perfect.</hi> To this ſtate, a proportionable degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in keeping the commandments, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: which by Gods grace may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Of this perfection S. Auguſtin ſpeaketh, when he ſaith: <hi>that the iuſtice, by which the iuſt man liues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. cont. duas epiſt. Pelag. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>albeit, for the capacity of this life, it be not vndeſervedly called perfect, yet it is little in regard of that great iuſtice, which the equality of Angels doth containe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it may eaſily appeare, in what ſenſe, the Commandments of God ought, &amp; may be kept perfectly, and in what not. To wit: they may be kept perfectly in all the parts, not one excepted, and in ſome degree of perfection, although they cannot be kept perfectly, during this life, in the higheſt degree, which is not commanded, nor required of vs. If the Presbyterians followed this ſenſe, they were not to be reproved, but they haue a quite contrary meaning. For they deny all poſſibility of keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments any wiſe perfectly, either in parts, or the loweſt degree of perfection: as may be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43743:82"/> ſeen in their new Catechiſme: where they ſay that no man is able, by any grace received in this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to keep the Commandments perfectly, but every one breakes them dayly in thought, word &amp; deed &amp;c. So that their ſenſe of the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to keep the Commandments <hi>perfectly,</hi> is moſt falſe, if not blaſphemous. For either God commandeth that perfection, which they ſay is above their force &amp; power, or he commandeth it not. If he commandeth it not; then they may fulfill the law perfectly; becauſe it is a law no further, then it commandeth: and if ſo far it may be fulfilled; then may it be fulfilled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Therefore it is falſe, which they ſay, that it cannot be fulfilled perfectly. If they ſay, that overplus of perfection, which is above their power, is commanded, as they do ordinarly; then they make God to be a Prince vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in commanding vs to do that which is not in our power to do; and to be Tyrannous &amp; cruell, in punishing vs eternally, for not doing that, which was above our reach to perform. All which do make againſt the wiſdome, goodneſſe &amp; iuſtice of God: and therefore theſe opinions are condemned by the holy Fathers, &amp; by ſome Proteſtants, as blaſphemous. Thus ſpake the Catholique.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I remember he shew me, that there was a notable difference, in this matter, betwen the Catholiques &amp; the Presbyterians. For the laſt, ſaid he, do free themſelves, and put the blame of all their wickedneſſe and ſluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpon God; alleadging that he hath given
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43743:83"/> them a law impoſſible to be kept, even with all the help &amp; grace that he gives them. But the Catholiques do free God of all blame, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute iuſtly their breaking of the law, to their own wickedneſſe alone. S. Hierome shewes the humour of the Presbyterians, in theſe words:<note place="margin">Hier. epiſt. ad Celant.</note> 
                  <hi>We cry againſt God, and we ſay, that we are oppreſſed with the difficulty or impoſsibility of his Commandments. Neither is it ſufficient, that we do not keep his Commandments; vnleſſe We pronounce the Commander to be vniuſt: whilſt we complaine, that the Authour of equity, hath Commanded not only hard things, but alſo impoſsibilities.</hi> The Church of Chriſt, ſaid the ſame Catholique, hath been troubled in this matter, with two oppoſite hereſies, to witt: of the Pelagians &amp; the Calviniſts. The firſt taught of old, that the Commandments were poſſible to be kept, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout the grace of God: and the others of late teach, that the Commandments are impoſſible to be kept, even with the grace of God. The Church of Chriſt keeps the medium of truth, between theſe oppoſite errours. Againſt the firſt she teacheth, that the Commandments may be kept, but not without Gods grace: and againſt the ſecond, that they may be kept with Gods grace. And therefore, againſt both theſe enemies, as well to one another, as to grace; she defends the grace of God. Againſt the firſt, she shewes the neceſſity of grace; and againſt the ſecond, she maintaines the power &amp; efficacy of it. But there is this notable difference, between Pelagius &amp; Calvin, in their oppoſition of grace; that the firſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43743:83"/> is an open enemy to it, and the ſecond is a great friend in words, but no leſſe enemy in deeds. For, whilſt he vndervalues all the faculties and natural powers of man, he would ſeem to cry vp grace, &amp; to give all the glory to God. But when he teacheth again, that grace is not able to purify our ſoules, or make vs able to walk in the Commandments of God; he quite overthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes grace. God, who of his mercy delivered this Iſland from the firſt hereſy; may alſo, in his own time, deliver it from the ſecond. Thus he.</p>
               <p>But I did oppoſe vnto him that, which I heard ſome Miniſters ſay, that God might iuſtly command things impoſſible to man fallen: becauſe it is ſufficient, that they were poſſible to man, before his fall; and ſeing, by his own fault, they became vnpoſſible, God may iuſtly exact them, without the leaſt imputation either to his iuſtice or goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>To this he anſwered: that the authorities of the Scriptures &amp; holy Fathers, are for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the law, after the fall: And the Fathers shew by moſt ſolid reaſons, that God could neither with his iuſtice, or goodneſſe impoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible lawes, after the fall, &amp; punish the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours of them with eternal paines. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this reaſon or rather pretence of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, being no Scripture, but rather againſt Scripture, &amp; the holy Fathers, who knew found reaſon, as well as the Miniſters, is not to be regarded. 2. As a man who was rich, and had miſpent his eſtate, cannot be iuſtly commanded by any new law, to pay as much tribute as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43743:84"/> when he had his eſtate; nor be punished for not paying it thereafter, for ſuch a law would be both vniuſt &amp; ridiculous, commanding impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities: and ſo would be no law, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it, would be both vnreaſonable &amp; cruel. So man, after the fall of Adam, could not, by any new law, be iuſtly commanded by God, to do that, which was impoſſible vnto him, vnleſſe we would make that new law vniuſt and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, &amp; God him ſelf vnreaſonable &amp; Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. Therefore, ſince God made and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated his law, long after the fall of man, vſed, exhortations, propounded rewards, and threatned punishments, to induce men to keep it, and all his actions are iuſt and wiſe; they preſuppoſe neceſſarly the poſſibility of keeping that law with the aſſiſtance of his grace; or elſe ſuch things, would not be only againſt Gods goodneſſe, &amp; iuſtice; but alſo againſt ordinary prudence.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ſame Catholique shew me, that the Preſbyterians, who accuſe the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques falſy, for taking away the ſecond comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dment, as they call it (of which matter we shall haue occaſion to ſpeak more fitly hereafter) may be iuſtly accuſed, for taking away, in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not one, but alle the commandments: For their errour of the impoſſibility of them, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyes the end, for which they and all iuſt lawes are made, to wi t, that they may be kept; and ſo they deſtroy the Whole divine command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make them of no effect, yea this errour deſtroies alſo the end of Chriſts Incar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43743:84"/> &amp; Paſſion, if we will believe S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, For, having brougt many paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to this purpoſe, he ſubioyns, <hi>Quibus appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret D. Ieſum Chriſtum nullam aliam ob cauſam in carnem veniſſe &amp;c.</hi>

                  </note> where he sheweth very largely, that Chriſt, for no other cauſe, came vnto the world, and became obedient vnto the death of the Croſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that he might recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile ſinners to God, deſtroy the power of ſin, obtaine grace from God, to make vs walk in newneſſe of life, and in obedience of his holy commandments. Whereby it may be ſeen, what a dangerous fundamental errour this is, which is againſt ſuch principal &amp; fundamental points of the Chriſtian religion. Therefore the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, would de well to make vſe of the ſame holy Fathers ſound advice, when he ſaith. <hi>Let him, to whom the commandments are heavie, know,</hi>

                  <hi>that he hath not got the gift,</hi> to witt of the love of God, <hi>by which, they are made not heavie, but yet, though he find them heavie let him not, be broke with deſpaire, but let him be enforced and ſtirred vp, to ſeek, to beg, and to knock.</hi> But the Preſbyterians, (who hereby may know, that they want the love of God) cannot make immediat vſe of this wholſome counſel, to ſeek and beg that love of God, by which his commandments are made eaſy; till they firſt correct or rather quite their erroneous faith, whereof they make this a chiefe article, that it's impoſſible to love God, or keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Therefore they muſt firſt beg true faith, that they may believe Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dments
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43743:85"/> to be poſſible, with help of his grace; and then they may beg and obtaine the ſecond, to witt, the love of God, by which they may find grace to fulfill them. This article of the Preſbyterians faith gave occaſion to a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Gentleman of my acquentance, to ſay to the Preſbyterians, who were much preſſing him to ſubſcrib the Covenant: that he would never be of their religion: who profeſſed they did not love God; yea and made it an article of their faith, that they could not love him. Thus he.</p>
               <p>Having therefore diligently conſidered all theſe grounds, I could no longer believe the impoſſibility of keeping Gods commandments, even with the help of his grace, as an article of my faith reveald in Scripture; which I found to be againſt Scripture, and againſt the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, iuſtice and wiſdome of God; Which the holy Fathers &amp; ſome Proteſtants do call extream blaſphemy; which deſtroyes the vertue and power of Gods grace; which puts the blame of our negligence &amp; ſluggishneſſe, from our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and layes all vpon God: which is againſt the end of Chriſts Incarnation, &amp; merit of his Paſſſion; which hinders the growth of piety, and opens a gate to all wickedneſſe, and makes all the divine commandments of no effect. But, vpon the contrary, I reſolved by Gods grace, to embrace and believe the ancient Catholique doctrin, concerning the poſſibility of keeping the commandments with the help of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; Which I found to be ſo clearly expreſſed in Scriptures, ſo ſtrongly maintaind by the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43743:85"/> ſo conſonant to right reaſon, iuſtice &amp; piety, and which did make ſo much for the glory of Gods grace, &amp; the merits of Chriſts death and paſſion.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of Iuſtification by Faith onely, maintain'd by the Presbyterians and their firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, as the principal article of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</head>
               <p>AFTER the triall of our doctrine, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Commandments; I conſidered, in the next place, our doctrine of Iuſtification, not only becauſe this hath connexion with the former, but alſo for the importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the matter. For I haue read, and heard this article of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith onely, called by many Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, the ſoule and life of their religion, and of all articles the principal and greateſt; on the contrary, they call Iuſtification by works, the life of Popery: ſo that M. Fox ſaith, that Luther,<note place="margin">Fox Acts. Man. p. <hi>402.</hi>
                  </note> by opening a certaine veine which lay long hid, to witt, our Iuſtification by faith only, did overturne the foundation of Popery. Moreover, I haue heard it affirmed, that Iuſtification by faith only was ſo certaine a truth, and ſo eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly contain'd in the Scriptures, that ſome of the learned Papiſts, after they had much opppoſed it, were at lenth overcome by the ſtrenth of it, and made to acknowledge it: and there was no point of Popery, eſteem'd to be more abſurd,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43743:86"/> nor more againſt the Scriptures, then Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works: in ſo much that M, Knox, in his firſt ſermon at S. Andrewes, did make inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance principally in it:<note place="margin">Knox Chron. pag. <hi>76. 77.</hi>
                  </note> for thus ſpeaks his hiſtory of him: <hi>He plainly proved the Papiſts doctrine &amp; lawes, to repugne directly to the lawes of God the Father, and of Chriſt Ieſus his Son. This he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by conferring the doctrine of Iuſtification ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Scriptures: which teach that man is iuſtifyed by faith only &amp;c. and the doctrine of the Papiſts, which attributes iuſtification to the works of the law.</hi> And, vpon ſeverall occaſions, I haue heard the Miniſters pretend great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in this point, which they ordinarly vrge very much.</p>
               <p>Having then no ſmall expectation, to find ſuch expreſſe and convincing Scripture, for this point of Iuſtification by faith only; that any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent front cowld hardly deny it: I begun to conſider theſe paſſages, which they do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly bring, and cote on the margent of their Confeſſion; and I found, that not one of them containes in expreſſe words, the Presbyterian article, contradictory to the Papiſts; as may appeare to any man, who will read the words. Theſe paſſages are three, and the firſt is in S. Iohn, who ſaith: <hi>As many as received him, he gave them power to become the Sons of God, who believe in his name.</hi> The two others are in S. Paul:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note> who ſaith; <hi>We conclude,</hi> (or as it is in the Catholique tranſlation) <hi>We account a man to be iuſtifyed by faith without the workes of the law.</hi> And againe, <hi>being iuſtifyed therefore by faith: let
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43743:86"/> vs haue peace toward God.</hi> Now, in none of theſe places, can I find it written, that man is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by faith <hi>only,</hi> or, as it is in their new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, faith is the <hi>alone inſtrument of Iuſtification.</hi> I find indeed, that the Scripture ſaith there, that man is iuſtifyed by faith; but I can not find, where it ſaith by faith only, that word <hi>only</hi> or <hi>alone,</hi> which is the maine point in this matter, cannot be found in the Scripture: albeit M. Knox, in his foreſaid ſermon, falſly pretends, that it is expreſſed in Scripture.</p>
               <p>I admired to ſee both our firſt and laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, after ſuch huge pretences, to want expreſſe Scripture, for this maine article of their religion: but I admired much more, when I found the Catholique article, which is flatly contradictory to the Proteſtants, to be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Scriptures. S. Iames ſaith;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 2.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham our father was he not iuſtifyed by works, offering Iſaac his Son vpon the altar?</hi> And again. <hi>Do you ſee, that by works a man is iuſtifyed, and not by faith only?</hi> Where S. Iames directly contradicts the doctrine of the Proteſtants: for they ſay, A man is not iuſtifyed by works, but by faith only: and S. Iames ſaith: a man is iuſtifyed <hi>by works and not by faith only.</hi> I wondered how we could brag ſo much, that we had always the Scripture for vs, againſt the Papiſts; and yet, when I tryed the matter, I found ever hitherto the contrary, as may be found by any man, who will not renounce his ſenſes of hearing and ſeeing. But to find this in other points, I did not think it ſo ſtrange, as in the preſent, which is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43743:87"/> called the principal point of the Proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and wherein we did ſo much glory againſt the Papiſts, who haue much the better of vs, if we will acknowledge the expreſſe words of Scripture, and ſtand to them.</p>
               <p>But the Presbyterians pretend, that, although their article be not, word by word, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet the equivalent is there, when S. Paul ſaith: a man is iuſtifyed by faith, without the works of the law; which they ſay is all one, as if he had ſaid, by <hi>faith only.</hi> I found many wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghty reaſons againſt this Miniſteriall gloſſe. 1. At the beginning of their Reformation, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vs the pure word of God; and now they give vs, for it, their geſſes, or the word of man; which is a weak ground of faith. 2. which is yet worſe. Their words &amp; interpretations are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe termes againſt the word of God in another place, to witt in S. Iames, as we have ſeen. 3. They affirm that all points neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are clearly contain'd in Scripture. How comes it then, that this moſt neceſſary &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial point, which they call the life of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, is not there? yea, how comes it to paſſe that not only it is not in Scripture, but the quite contrary is word by word in Scripture: and that not ſimply affirmed, but proved by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; examples; and theſe who affirm the contrary are compared to Devils? 4. The holy Fathers &amp; primitive Church did never vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures, in that ſenſe; but in the contrary. How then could I, in ſenſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe things, make the Miniſters words
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43743:87"/> and interpretation, which are not Scripture, yea which are againſt Scripture, and againſt the holy Fathers, &amp; the beliefe of the primi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive Church, to be the principal article of my faith?</p>
               <p>S. Auguſtin shewes, that ſome men, in the Apoſtles own time, did miſinterpret the ſame words of S. Paul, as the Presbyterians do now, and made it the ground of the ſame errour.<note place="margin">Aug. de gr. &amp; lib. arb. cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>But men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not vnderſtanding what the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſaith: we account a man iuſtifyed by faith wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout works, thought, that he ſaid, faith would ſuffice a man, albeit he live ill, and have no good works. Which God forbid, that the veſſel of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should think &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the ſame holy Father shewes, that to roote out the errour of thoſe, who by miſconſtruing S. Pauls words, did gather from them, iuſtification by faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the other Apoſtles did principally direct the intentions of their Epiſtles. <hi>S. Peter, ſaith he,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>knowing that ſome wicked men took occaſion from ſome obſcure ſentences of S. Paul, as being ſecure of their ſalvation, which is in faith, had no care to live well, gave advertiſment, that there were ſome things, in his epiſtle, hard to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which men perverted (as they do the other Scriptures) to their own perdition.</hi> See, vpon what a dangerous ground, the principal article of our Reformation is founded, and how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous alſo it ſelf is. <hi>But S. Iames,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. ibid.</note> ſaith S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin, <hi>is ſo highly offended with theſe men, who think that faith without works can availe vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that he compares them even to Devils.</hi> And
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43743:88"/> then hauings brought theſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: <hi>Thou believeſt that there is one God, thou doſt well: the Devils alſo beleeve &amp; tremble,</hi> he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyns, <hi>Quid verius, brevius, vehementius dici potuit?</hi> what could be ſaid more truely, more briefly &amp; efficaciouſly? Thus S. Auguſtin. And that he alone did not condemne this errour, &amp; maintained the Catholique doctrin oppoſite to it,<note place="margin">Cent. Mag. cent. <hi>23. 4. 5.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi> Aug hae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſ. <hi>54.</hi>
                  </note> is manifeſt, by the Confeſſion of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiſts, who, for this cauſe, taxe the moſt ancient fathers, as S. Clement, Origen, S. Cyprian, S. Hierome, S. Ambroſe, Auguſtin, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, &amp; many more. Moreover, the ſame S. Auguſtin shewes, that this errour of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith only, was the ancient hereſy of Eunomius;<note place="margin">Iren. cont. haereſ. c. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> and S. Ireneus aſcribes it alſo to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus. And yet this ancient hereſy againſt the Scripture, &amp; the holy Fathers, is obtruded vpon vs, as the principal article of our faith, by our Reformers: who yet pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, but pure Scripture. Therefore I reſolued by Gods grace not to believe any longer ſuch a wicked opinion, as the principal article of my religion: but, vpon the contrary, I intended to embrace &amp; follow the Catholique doctrin, oppoſite to it: which I found to be, in expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſe termes, in the Scriptures, which were ſo vnderſtood and beleeved by the holy Fathers.</p>
               <p>I vas much confirmed in this reſolution, when I vnderſlood, how Luther &amp; Calvin, hauing no Scripture for them, but againſt them, haue groſly abuſed it to maintaine their errour. For Luther, the firſt Apoſtle, in this laſt age, of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43743:88"/> this new doctrine, did two notable iniuries to the word of God. For, Seeing that this prime article of his faith, was not expreſly contain'd, in the Scripture, by an vnparallel'd preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, he added the word <hi>ſola or Alone</hi> to the Scripture, in his German tranſlation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble And whereas S. Paul ſaith: <hi>we account a man iuſtifyed by faith, without the workes of the law;</hi> he makes him ſay, <hi>by faith alone</hi> And when this high temerity, of adding to the word of God, was obiected to him:<note place="margin">Luth. tom. <hi>5.</hi> Germ. fol. <hi>141.</hi> &amp; d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m.</note> he defended it with moſt inſolent words, ſaying: that a Papiſt and an aſſe was the ſame thing: and that the word <hi>ſola</hi> should remaine in his Bible, although all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the world, shoud go mad, and be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to in Aſſes. The ſecond iniury, that he did to the Scripture, was not by Addition, but by Diminution, wherin he was much more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, then in the firſt: for he added only one word, but he took away many hundreds. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, finding that the words above cited of S. Iames epiſtle, were clearly &amp; expreſly againſt his doctrin, he expunged the whole epiſtle, out of the Canon of the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Luth in praef. in novu n Teſt. Luth in cap. <hi>22.</hi> Geneſ.</note> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it an epiſtle <hi>of ſtraw, vnworthy the Spirit of an Apoſtle.</hi> Yea, he arrived to that impudency, that he ſaid the Authour of that epiſtle <hi>delirat,</hi> that is <hi>dotes,</hi> or <hi>raves.</hi> By theſe two practiſes, I was moved to think, that Luther could not be the ſecond Elias, the Reſtorer of purity &amp; true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who would not only reform the Church, but alſo the Scriptures: yea, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he hath incurred not one, but both the curſes threatned by S. Iohn, for adding to, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43743:89"/> pareing from the Scriptures. And by this, I perceived alſo, what little eſteem, they make of the Scripture, when it makes againſt their errours.</p>
               <p>Calvin went more ſubtilly to work; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he followed Luthers doctrin of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; yet he neither added the word <hi>Sola,</hi> to the letter of the Scripture, neither did he deny S. Iames epiſtle, to be Canonical: But, what Luther added to the letter, Calvin added to the ſenſe; and what Luther denyed, the other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. For Calvin would have Iuſtification by faith <hi>only,</hi> to be as firmly believed, as if the word <hi>only</hi> were there in Scripture, which indeed, is all one, as if he had added, with Luther, that word to the Scripture. Then the words of S. Iames, which are clearly oppoſite to his errour, and for which, Luther did reiect the whole epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he doth ſo corrupt with new ſenſes, which Luthers more groſſe head could not invent, that they paſſe many mens ſenſes &amp; vnderſtandings too, and are againſt the words of Scripture, &amp; clearly againſt the ſenſe of the holy Fathers. For he ſaith, <hi>faith alone</hi> doth iuſtify, but <hi>not alone.</hi> Some others of his Schollers explaine it thus: <hi>fides ſola iuſtificat, ſed non ſolitaria.</hi> Others ſay: faith doth iuſtify, and <hi>not works;</hi> but yet faith <hi>not without works;</hi> or a man is iuſtifyed <hi>with</hi> works, but not <hi>by</hi> works; and works are the <hi>means,</hi> but not the <hi>cauſes</hi> of Iuſtification. But all theſe inventions, are directly contrary to the words of S. Iames. For he ſaith, man is iuſtifyed by works, &amp; not by faith only. He doth not ſay,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43743:89"/> man is iuſtifyed <hi>with</hi> works; but <hi>by</hi> works: he doth not ſay, he is iuſtifyed <hi>by faith only;</hi> but <hi>not by faith only.</hi> And after the ſame manner and expreſſion, that he aſcribeth our iuſtification to faith, he aſcribs it alſo vnto works. He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaks of cauſes, nor means: theſe are the Miniſters words, and not the word of God; which is not cleared, but rendred more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure by them. It was made appear to me, that the queſtion at firſt between the Catholiques &amp; Luther, was; whether good works were in any reſpect neceſſary to our iuſtification: and not, whether they were required as cauſes or conditions. Luther ſaid, they were in no wiſe neceſſary, or elſe none could be iuſtifyed; ſince the beſt works of the greateſt Saints are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſins. And in this, he ſpake conſequentially to his principles. But Calvin, finding that the Catholiques by innumerable Scriptures, and particularly by that place of S. Iames, proved the neceſſity of good works vnto Iuſtification; he invented a diſtinction, not to cleare, but to confound the matter, that good works were neceſſary, but not as <hi>cauſes,</hi> and faith was the only cauſe of Iuſtification. And this he did alſo very vnreaſonably againſt the principle, which he holds common with Luther, to witt, that all our beſt actions are deadly ſins. For, if good works be in any manner neceſſary, how can any be iuſtifyed, according to Calvin, who maintains there can be no good works, but that all are mortal ſins? For, if a condition be neceſſary to any effect; then if the condition be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43743:90"/> not fulfilled, the effect cannot be produced. As approximation of wood vnto the fire, is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly called the condition, without which the wood could not take fire. Therefore as the wood, if it were not put near the fire; would not conceive fire, ſo alſo, if good works be a neceſſary condition vnto iuſtification, (as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin pretends) no man can be iuſtifyed: ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, there can be no good works. Therefore Calvin ſpeaks very inconſequential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not alſo falſly.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it was showen me: that the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans were ſo highly offended with theſe new gloſſes of Calvin &amp; his Schollers, that they call them the doctrins of the new Papiſts, more pernicious, then theſe of the old: and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyricus,<note place="margin">Illyr in praef. ep ad Rom.</note> a famous Lutheran, doth not ſtand to call theſe Calviniſts, <hi>Seducers, who by diuerſe waye,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>would elude the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S. Paul &amp;c.</hi> For this cauſe the Lutherans deny all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of good works vnto Salvation, either as means, or cauſes. For this, they profeſſed at the conference of Altenberg,<note place="margin">Coll. Al ten. col. <hi>4</hi> f. <hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>We conclude,</hi> ſay they, <hi>with that worthy ſaying of Luther: If works be neceſſary vnto Salvation; then none can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without works: and then we would not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith only.</hi> So I found at length, that this prime article of our religion, to witt; that man is iuſtifyed by faith only, after ſo many great brags, is not in Scripture, but againſt Scripture, as the Lutherans vnderſtand it: and as Calvin takes it, its not only againſt Scripture, but alſo againſt his own principle, who makes the whole matter, to end in Philoſophical termes, for the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43743:90"/> moſt part, neither vnderſtood by ſpeakers nor hearers. Of which matter, I had not long ago, a notable experience. For being in a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans houſe in the countrey, where there chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be a Miniſter of eſteem'd learning, two Roman Catholiques, and diverſe Proteſtants: as the ordinary diſcours now a dayes, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning religion, ſo I heard one at that time. For the Miniſter, taking occaſion by hearing Cardinal Bellarmin named, ſpake at firſt, much in his praiſe, ſaying: that none of all the Popish Authors, did relate ſo faithfully the Proteſtant Tenets, nor argumented more clearly, then he did. Yet at length, ſaid the Miniſter, after the Cardinal hath shewed the ſtrength of his wit, at the iſſue of the matter, being convinced by the force of truth; he concludes, for the moſt part, with the Proteſtants. Wherevpon; one of the Catholiques preſent ſaid, that he admired very much, how Bellarmin, who had written ſo much for Popry, should be eſteem'd a Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: &amp; merrily ſubioyn'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that himſelf was iuſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, as Bellarmin was. After there had paſs'd a little laughter, occaſioned by theſe words; the other Catholique did gravely deſire the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, to shew; wherein Bellarmin was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant. Wherevpon, the Miniſter inſtanced in this ſame matter of Iuſtification, and ſaid: that after Bellarmin had wearied himſelf, by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing many teſtimonies of Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to prove, that we are iuſtifyed by works and not by faith only: he in end yeelds the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to tthe Proeſtants: for he concludes: <hi>That
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43743:91"/> it is moſt ſafe to rely vpon the merits of Chriſt.</hi> And ſo, in one ſentence, he deſtroyeth, what he had been building a long time. To which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique replyed: that if Bellarmin was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant for that, then all Catholiques were Proteſtants: for they all profeſſed the ſame. Neither was the Catholiques relying on Chriſt merits, any way againſt iuſtification by good works; more then the Proteſtants relying on the ſame merits, was againſt their ſuppoſed Iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by faith only. But ſaid he: I admire very much, how you ordinarly pretend ſo great advantage, in your doctrin of Iuſtification by faith only, which you eſteem the principal article of your religion; and yet it cannot be found in all the Scripture, the only pretended ground of all your faith: And how you can crye ſo much againſt the Catholiques, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that we are iuſtifyed by works, &amp; not by faith only; which is expreſly, and word by word, in the Scripture. For doth not S. Iames clearly ſay: <hi>Ye ſee, that man is iuſtifyed by works, and not by faith only.</hi> The Miniſter finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus engaged, paſs'd preſently from the Scripture, &amp; enquired of the Catholique, whom he knew well enough not to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Scholler; If he had any Logique. Who anſwered, he had not much: but he had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this purpoſe. That there was not much Logique required, to ſee what was contained in Scripture. He would truſt his owne eyes, in that matter. It was ſufficient for him, that he had on his ſide the expreſſe Scripture, which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43743:91"/> is better then Logique. But the Miniſter told him; that, although theſe words are in Scripture; yet they muſt be vnderſtood in a ſound ſenſe. For works, ſaid he, although they be neceſſary to iuſtification; yet they are not the cauſes of it, but in a very improper ſenſe. For you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there are diverſe kinds of cauſes; there is <hi>cauſa efficiens, cauſa formalis,</hi> and <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> which is not a cauſe properly. Now works are not the efficient, nor formal cauſe; but only <hi>cauſa ſine qua non.</hi> They are <hi>via regni;</hi> and not <hi>cauſa regnandi.</hi> And ſo, after this manner, he made a long diſcours, involving the matter in great obſcurities, paſſing the reach of the hearers; if not alſo overpaſſing his own vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. But the Catholique holding him ſtill by his grounds, told the Miniſter that his Logique was no Scripture; and that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, are brought to a low ebb, when they are enforced to acknowlege that this prime ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their faith, is not expreſly in Scripture, as they at firſt pretended: And now, when the quite oppoſite doctrine, maintaind by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, (againſt which the Miniſters did ſo much raile) is showe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be expreſly in Scripture: they are enforced to run from Scripture, to their Logique: which indeed, is to yeeld the cauſe to the Catholiques, and to quite ground. For at firſt they pretended nothing but Scripture: and now they flie to Ariſtotles Logique, and that againſt the expreſſe words of Scripture, making the whole matter end in a Logomachy: which is ſo much the worſe, on the Proteſtants ſide; ſeing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43743:92"/> they will not vſe the very phraſe of Scripture, which the Catholiques keep. And vpon this followes alſo another evil, that the people, being made to believe, <hi>that they are iuſtifyed by faith only, and not by works;</hi> makes by natural Logique, this inference, (which all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the world with all their artificial Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique, will not put out of their heads) that good works are not neceſſary; and ſo they altogether neglect them. Thus ended that conference (the Miniſter replying ſomething; but little to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) with ſmall ſatisfaction of ſome Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants preſent; who imagined, that this prime article of their faith, had been better grounded: and that this Miniſter, whom they much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, could haue ſaid more, then to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that his faith was againſt the words of Scripture: and in end, to run to his Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſtinctions, which were not by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
               <p>But, albeit I was ſufficiently ſatisfyed, by what hath been ſaid, of the truth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique doctrin, concerning Iuſtification; yet being deſirous, that I might be able to diſcern more fully, the deceits and obſcurities, which the Miniſters invent, to elude the clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: a Catholique, whoſe aſſiſtance I requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, shew me, that for this end, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I should firſt know the nature of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the doctrin of the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church. For, as a Rule, ſaid he, is a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to diſcern both what is right, and what is crooked; ſo truth, is a manifeſtation both of it
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43743:92"/> ſelf, and of falshood. Wherevpon, he had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcourſes with me, on this matter; the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of which, I will briefly collect.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the Nature of Iustification, according to the Catholique doctrine.</head>
               <p>ALBEIT you haue ſeen evidently, ſaid the Catholique vnto me, that according to the expreſſe Scriptures, man is iuſtifyed by works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; not by faith only; yet, that you may know how this is done, and what works are excluded from iuſtification, according to S. Paul; and what theſe works are, by which we are iuſtifyed, according to S. Iames; yow muſt know the nature of Iuſtification of a ſinner: which, according to the Catholique Church, is thus deſcribed. Iuſtification of a ſinner, is the tranſlation of one, from the ſtate of ſin, into the ſtate of grace; a changing of one, from being an enemy, to make him become the friend of God. There is the miſery, from which a ſinner is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; &amp; the happineſſe, to which he is brought. Now, that he may come from ſuch a miſerable condition, to ſuch a happy eſtate, there are ſome preparations and diſpoſitions required to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the ſoule of a ſinner, that is come to age; of which kind only we here ſpeak. Firſt God of his meer mercy, by his preveening and helping grace, doth excite and call a ſinner,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43743:93"/> without any of his preceeding merits, as it were, out of the ſleep of ſin; that he may convert himſelf vnto God. 2. A ſinner being thus awakned, and aſſiſted by the Divine grace, conceiving faith by hearing, doth believe all things to be true, which are revealed &amp; promiſed by God; &amp; particularly, that a ſinner is iuſtifyed by the free mercy of God, through the redemption, which is in Chriſt Ieſus. 3. This faith repreſenting God to be a ſevere punisher of ſins, there ariſeth in a ſinner, thus diſpoſed by faith, a fear of Gods iudgments, with which the Soule is profitably shaken &amp; terrifyed.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.7.</note> For as Salomon ſaith: <hi>the feare of our Lord, is the beginning of wiſdome.</hi> 4. The ſoule of a ſinner being thus terrifyed, it is raiſed vp againe to hope, by the ſame faith; which repreſents God to be moſt bountifull &amp; mercyfull, in forgiveing ſins. For which cauſe, he ſent his ſon into the world, to deliver vs from ſin, by his death. 5. Vpon this hope &amp; confidence in the divine mercy, there ariſeth the love of God, who is ſo bountifull and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfull; and likwiſe a hatred and deteſtation of ſin, which God hateth, a ſorrow and grief for what is paſt; and a firm reſolution of a better life in time to come: a purpoſe of obſerving the divine Commandments, &amp; of receiving the holy Sacraments. Now all theſe diſpoſitions of fa th, fear, love, hope, and the reſt, being placed in the ſoule of man, by Gods preveening grace; Iuſtification, or the infuſion of iuſtifying grace, doth follow, as we shall ſee shortly.</p>
               <p>That theſe preparations &amp; difpoſitions are
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43743:93"/> neceſſary before iuſtification, the Scripture shewes. Our Saviour shew the neceſſity of preveening grace, when he ſaid:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.44. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.28. <hi>&amp; ibid, v.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>No man can come vnto me, vnleſſe my Father draw him.</hi> Of faith, S. Paul ſaith: <hi>that without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to pleaſe God: for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is; and that he is a Rewarder of thoſe who ſeek him.</hi> Of fear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the former teſtimony of Salomon, it is ſaid; that, <hi>who is without fear, cannot be iuſtifyed.</hi> And again: <hi>the fear of our Lord chaſeth away ſin.</hi> S. Paul ſaith of hope, that <hi>we are ſaved by it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47.</note> Of love our Saviour ſaith: <hi>Many ſins are forgiven her; for she loved much.</hi> And that repentance is alſo neceſſary, there is nothing more clear, in the Scriptures. By all which teſtimonies, it remaines evident, that although faith be the firſt diſpoſition of the ſoule to iuſtification; yet the others above-mentioned are alſo requiſite. Neither can there be any difficulty in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince it is as clear as the Sun, that no man, of a ſinner, can become the friend of God: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he haue not only faith, but alſo the fear &amp; love of God, with hope in his mercy, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſins. To this purpoſe S. Auguſtin ſaith:<note place="margin">Aug de predeſt. ſanct. cap. <hi>7</hi> Idem ſerm. <hi>22.</hi> de Verb. Dom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>fides prima datur, ex qua caetera impetrantur.</hi> That is: <hi>faith is firſt given, by which the reſt are obtain'd.</hi> And again: <hi>the houſe of God is founded by Faith, raiſed vp hy hope, and perfected by Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And as in this ſenſe, it is truly ſaid that faith doth iuſtify, to wit as a fundamentall &amp; radicall diſpoſition to Iuſtification; ſo it is no leſſe true, that fear, hope, love, &amp; repentance,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43743:94"/> do alſo iuſtify, to witt as ſecondary diſpoſitions proceeding from faith: becauſe theſe likwiſe diſpoſe the ſoule fitly, to receive the forme of iuſtice, and to become the friend of God; and the Scripture aſcribes forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins, Salvation or Iuſtification to them, as it doth vnto faith. For as our Saviour told S. Mary Magdalen, that her faith had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.</note> ſo he ſaid: that <hi>many ſins were forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her, becauſe she loved much,</hi> and S. Paul ſaith, we <hi>are ſaved by hope;</hi> and S. Iames ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that <hi>we are iuſtifyed by works, &amp; not by faith only.</hi> By which conſideration it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily vnderſtood, what works S. Paul excludes from Iuſtification, when he ſaith, that a man is iuſtifyed by faith without the works of the law. For he doth not exclude, the works of grace, but only the works of the law, which are done by the ſtrength of nature, without the grace of God, and do not proceed from faith, but go before it. Now it is certaine that ſuch works, as not proceeding from faith, do not properly diſpoſe and prepare the ſoule vnto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.<note place="margin">Concil.

                  </note> For, as the Councel of Trent teacheth, faith is the foundation, roote, and beginning of all Salvation &amp; Iuſtification, and is the firſt effect of Gods free grace, in the Soule of man. But the Apoſtle doth not exclude from iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the works of grace, which follow faith: for they do iuſtify, that is, diſpoſe the Soule vnto Iuſtification, as faith it ſelf doth: and they proce d alſo from grace, as faith proceeds from it; and therefore are not the works of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43743:94"/> the law, but the works of grace. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, doth that great Doctour S. Auguſtin clearly reconcile theſe two places of S. Paul &amp; S. Iames.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>83.</hi> quaeſt. <hi>76.</hi>

But, albeit Iuſtification followeth theſe diſpoſitions, of faith, love, repentance, &amp; &amp; the reſt, yet it is altogether free, proceeding from the mercy &amp; bounty of God, without the deſert of man. For the Catholique Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth openly, notwitſtanding the Miniſters ſtrong calumnies to the contrary, that no man by any faith, or works, can merit the grace of Iuſtification,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. ſeſs. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> as the Councel of Trent teacheth in theſe words. <hi>We are ſaid to be freely iuſtifyed, becauſe none of thoſe things, which preceed Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, whether faith or works, doth merit the grace of Iuſtification.</hi> Now this grace conſiſteth in two thing,s to witt: in Remiſſion of ſins, and inward ſanctification: by the firſt, the ſoule is changed &amp; purged from ſin, which is the filthineſſe of the Soule; and by the ſecond, it is adorned and beautifyed with grace; which is the beauty of it: and made to die vnto ſin, &amp; live vnto iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43743:95"/> But it muſt be diligently obſerved: that the Catholiques do teach, according to the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that in Iuſtification, our ſins are not ſo forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that they remaine in the Soule; but they are quite taken away. For S. Iohn ſaith of Chriſt: <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28.</note>

Therefore in iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſins do not remaine, but they are really taken away.</p>
               <p>As the ſoule, in Iuſtification is purged and cleanged from the filthineſſe of ſins, which are ſo forgiven, that they are really taken away; ſo it is alſo beautifyed with inward grace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent iuſtice, by which, he who was before a ſinner, is renewed in the Spirit of his mind, and hath the love of God powred forth in his heart, by the holy Ghoſt.

                  </note> For the efficient cauſe, is our mercyfull God: the meritorious, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: the final cauſe, the glory of God, &amp; of Chriſt, and life everlaſting: and the formal cauſe, is the Iuſtice of God, not that, by which he himſelf is iuſt; but that, by which he makes vs iuſt: and with which, we being endowed, are renewed in the Spirit of our mind, and are not only reputed, but truly are iuſt.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid the Catholique to me, that you may vnderſtand more fully, how we are made formally iuſt, not by that iuſtice, which is in God, but by that iuſtice, which proceeding from God, is in vs; I will illuſtrate the matter, a litle more vnto yow. As ſin is the death of the ſoule; ſo grace and iuſtice is the life of it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, as the natural life of man, is the formal cauſe of his living naturally; ſo his ſpiritual life, which is grace &amp; iuſtice, is the formal cauſe of his living ſpiritually. As then the natural life
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43743:96"/> or ſoule of man, by which he lives naturally, albeit it be from God, yet it is not that life by which God lives, but it is that life, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by God to man, by which man lives; and therefore cannot be any thing external, but muſt be internal in man: So the Spiritual life of the ſoule, which is grace &amp; iuſtice, by which man lives Spiritually, is not the iuſtice, which is in God, or by which God is iuſt; but that iuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which is communicated by God to man, whereby man is rendred iuſt, and lives Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually: and therefore muſt be internal in him: ſince nothing can live; either naturally, or Spiritually, by any thing which is external vnto it. The example of the raiſing Lazarus from the the dead, will yet more cleare this matter. For if Chriſt, calling Lazarus from the grave, had not given him inward life; Lazarus could not haue riſen again, and lived by the life of Chriſt, which was without him. But it was neceſſary, for the reſurection of Lazarus, that his own life should be inwardly reſtored to him by Chriſt. It is ſo in our caſe: for a man, who is raiſed by Chriſt from the death of ſin vnto the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, muſt have grace or iuſtice, which is the Spiritual life of the ſoule, inwardly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him by Chriſt, the fountain and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of all iuſtice, and the ſource of all Spirituall life; or elſe man could not be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the death of ſin, and live ſpiritually.

But they could not riſe from the death of ſin, nor be quickned, &amp; renewed inwardly, and be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by his grace; vnleſſe they had ſpiritual life, which is grace or iuſtice, inwardly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore theſe, who riſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of ſin, &amp; are iuſtifyed, quickned &amp; inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, have the ſpiritual life of iuſtice flowing from the merits &amp; iuſtice of Chriſt, inwardly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43743:97"/> remaining in them. And hence doth appear clearly the truth of that, which the Catholique Church teacheth, to witt: that we are made iuſt, by the iuſtice of God, not by that, wherby he himſelf is iuſt, but by which he makes vs iuſt. For, as nothing can make an man iuſt, but iuſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tice; So it is not the external iuſtice of Chriſt; but it muſt be internal iuſtice, flowing from, his merits and iuſtice, that can quicken vs.</p>
               <p>This raiſing of one, from the death of ſin, to the life of Iuſtice, is called by the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, the firſt Iuſtification; by which one, of a ſinner, is made the friend of God. And it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free, proceeding meerly from the grace &amp; favour of God, without all works and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of man. Of this, S. Paul ſpeaks to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,<note place="margin">Aug. de Spir. &amp; lit. c <hi>4-</hi>
                  </note> when he ſaith: <hi>We conclude that man is iuſtifyed by faith, without the works of the law.</hi> Where S. Auguſtin vnderſtands by the works of the law, not only the works of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and Iudicial law, but alſo of the Moral law, which are done by the force of nature, or by the inſight of the law, without the help of grace in Chriſt; which help is not given except one haue firſt faith in Chriſt: which is the roote of ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; firſt effect of the divin grace, in our ſoules. Therefore if man could not be iuſtifyed by theſe works of the law, albeit he did them: much leſſe can he be iuſtifyed by theſe works, when he breaketh the law, as S. Paul proveth, in the ſame epiſtle: that both Iewes and Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les haue ſinned; and therefore ſtand in need of the mercy of God; and conſequently muſt be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43743:97"/> iuſtifyed, by the faith &amp; grace of Chriſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids this firſt Iuſtification, there is another, which the Catholiques call the ſecond Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; by which one, is not of impious made iuſt, but of iuſt, he is made more iuſt, and of a friend made yet more intimate with God; according to that in the Apocalypſe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apocal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 18.22.</note> 
                  <hi>He that is iuſt, let him be iuſtifyed even vnto death.</hi> Of this Iuſtification, are vnderſtood the words of S. Iames, when he ſaith: <hi>That a man is iuſtifyed by works, and not by faith only.</hi> That is; by works following after faith, &amp; flowing from it: for ſuch works are not the works of the law; that is; they are not works done meerly by the force of nature, or by the only knowledge of the law; but they are the works of grace, as faith it ſelf is: and by theſe works we are iuſtifyed, and not by faith only. This ſecond Iuſtification is acquired by doing all works of iuſtice and piety, by which, a man being in the ſtate of grace, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth a further augmentation of it. S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin brings S. Paul,<note place="margin">Aug lib. de gra. &amp; lib. ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> as an example of both theſe Iuſtifications. For, before his converſion he was found with no good merits; but rather with many evil merits, who was perſecuting the Church: and yet he obtain'd mercy. Therefore he was not iuſtifyed by his works, or by the deeds of the law, but by the faith or grace of Chriſt. But after his converſion &amp; firſt Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the ſame Apoſtle reckons out the good works he had done,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 4.6.</note> by which he had advanced in piety &amp; iuſtice. <hi>I am even now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be ſacrificed: and the time of my reſolution is at

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the Presbyterians three principall Errours, concerning Iuſtification.</head>
               <p>HAVING thus ſeen the truth of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Catholique doctrin, I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take ſpecial notice, of three principall and moſt groſſe errours, maintain'd by the Presbyterians, againſt it. The firſt is: that they do not only place the whole nature of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43743:98"/> in remiſſion of ſins; but they likwiſe teach, that, although our ſins be forgiven in Iuſtification: yet they are not taken away, but that they really remaine in the perſon iyſtified: and are only covered, and not imputed. The ſecond errour is, that a man iuſtified hath no internal nor inherent iuſtice in him, as being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together defiled inwardly with ſin: but that he is only iuſt, by the external iuſtice of Chriſt, with which he is covered, and which is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him. The third and laſt errour conſiſts in this, that they teach, this external iuſtice of Chriſt, is applyed vnto man, by faith only: and that not by a Chriſtian or Catholique faith, wherby one believes the articles of the Creed, or ſuch things as God hath revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but by a ſpecial faith, as they call it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every one believes for certaine, that his ſins are forgiven him, and that he is one of the predeſtinate.</p>
               <p>The firſt errour, to witt: that ſins remaine, and are not taken away from the perſon iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, maintain'd by Calvin and the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; I found to be againſt cripture, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts paſſion, &amp; the efficacy of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. S. Iohn Baptiſt calleth Chriſt, the lamb of God that <hi>taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi>

Paul ſaith: that Chriſt was offered vp once to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the ſins of many.</hi> And S. Iohn affirmeth that the blood of Chriſt <hi>cleanſeth vs from all ſins.</hi> Ananias ſaid to S. Paul: Ariſe and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and <hi>wash away thy ſins.</hi> If our ſins be taken away, as S. Iohn affirmeth: how do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43743:99"/> as the Presbyterians believe? If our ſins be washed away, and cleanſed by the blood of Chriſt, and by baptiſme; how can the filthineſſe and blots of them remaine? David ſaith to God:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 31.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Wash me, and I shall be whiter then ſnow.</hi> But, according to the Presbyterians, he behoved to remaine as black as pitch, and as filthie as the puddle; even with all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, that God would beſtow vpon him. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore this Presbyterian doctrin is againſt the Scriptures, the vertue of Chriſts paſſion, and the efficacy of baptiſme: and it is alſo clearly againſt the holy Fathers, as we shall ſee shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly in the Triall of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe clear authorities the Calviniſts bring principally one place of Scripture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon they found their errour: and that is in the 31. Pſalme, where David ſaith: <hi>Bleſſed are they, whoſe iniquities are forgiven, &amp; whoſe ſins are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> I admired, that for this one teſtimony, which ſaith that our ſins are covered, they should deny ſo many, which shew that ſins are taken away; and will not rather confeſſe with the Scripture, that they are both covered and taken away. S. Auguſtin sheweth excellently on this place how God doth both. For, comparing him to a Surgeon or Phyſician,<note place="margin">Aug. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>narr. in Pſ. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> he ſaith: that God doth ſo cover the wound with a plaiſter; that he cureth it, and taketh it away. Calvin &amp; his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers make Chriſt to be a very imperfect Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Phyſician; who can neither heale the ſick, nor cure the wounded ſoules, but only can caſt a cover vpon them. Such a Phyſician
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43743:99"/> of the body, who could do nothing, but throw his cloake vpon the ſick or wounded; and neither be able, to take away the ſickneſſe or wounds, would be in ſmall eſteem, and little employed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond groſſe errour of Calvin, which denyeth inherent iuſtice, is ſufficiently above refuted. Where it was shewed out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; Fathers, that we are quickned by Chriſt, and that iuſtice or grace proceeding from the iuſtice of Chriſt, the meritorious cauſe of our iuſtice, is the ſpiritual life of the Soule, which quickens it; and therefore muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and inherent within vs. For as one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live naturally, vnleſſe he have internal life wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin him; ſo neither can one live Spiritually, by any thing that is without him; but he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarly, have the life of grace or iuſtice within him. This truth is ſo ſtrong, that Calvin did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metime acknowledge it: for he ſaith,<note place="margin">Cal. lib. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Eccl. p. <hi>316.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>we are never reconciled to God, but we are alſo</hi> gifted <hi>with inherent iuſtice.</hi> But at other times he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently oppoſeth it, affirming, that the moſt holy and iuſt perſons are nothing inwardly, but filthy ſinners: and that all their iuſtice conſiſts only in the external iuſtice of Chriſt, which is imputed to them, and with which their ſins and filthyneſſe are covered.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 23.27.</note> So that Calvins iuſt men are not vnfitly by ſome compared to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sepulchres (to which our Saviour compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Phariſees) that outwardly appeare vnto men beautifvll, but within are full of dead mens bones &amp; all filthineſſe. So the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43743:100"/> would appeare beautifull outwardly, by the iuſtice of Chriſt; but inwardly they are full of filthineſſe &amp; iniquity. They are alſo like Wolves in sheeps clothing, who haue an external shew of meekneſſe &amp; iuſtice: but inwardly are ravenous creatures. But as sheeps clothing doth not make a wolfe, to become a lamb; ſo neither will the external iuſtice of Chriſt, that innocent lamb, with which a ſinner would cloth himſelf out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and yet remaine ſtill in his ſins, make him a Saint.<note place="margin">Iohn. e iſt. <hi>1</hi>

                  </note> S. Iohn giveth a ſerious warning to this purpoſe; <hi>Little children,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let no man ſeduce you. He that doth iuſtice is iuſt, even as he alſo,</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>is iuſt.</hi> Therefore, they are ſeduced, who think to be iuſt; and yet will do no iuſtice, as Chriſt did,</p>
               <p>The third errour, to witt: that faith alone doth iuſtify, is alſo above refuted. For 1. it hath been shewed not to be in Scripture; And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the Presbytetians make it very vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably &amp; againſt their own principles, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal article of their religion. 2. It is not only not to be found in Scripture, but it is expreſly word by word againſt Scripture, as hath been ſeen out of S. Iames. Therefore, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians brags of great advantage, in this point, are very falſe and groundleſſe. 3. It is alſo againſt the holy Fathers, who condemned it, as we haue ſeen, in ſome ancient heretiques. Yea S. Auguſtin doth affirm, that becauſe it had riſen in the very time of the Apoſtles, by miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the words of S. Paul, the other Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles as S. Peter, S. Iames, &amp; S. Iohn did direct
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43743:100"/> the intention of their epiſtles, and wrote moſt earneſtly, to roote out that errour, from the minds of men And S. Paul alſo did expreſſe himſelf ſufficiently againſt this errour, when he ſaid: that albeit he had all faith, ſo that he could remove mountains: if he had not charity,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13.</note> which he calleth greater, and more excellent, then faith and hope, he would be nothing, and his faith would profite him nothing. Whence S. Auguſtin ſaith: that it is charity,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>15.</hi> de Trin. cap. <hi>27.</hi> Leo ſerm. de collect. Shel. p. <hi>108. 108.</hi>
                  </note> which makes all vertues profitable; and that faith may be preſent, but it cannot profite without charity, and S. Leo ſaith: that charity <hi>quickens faith it ſelf, by which the iuſt man lives.</hi> Yea M. Shelford the Proteſtant Miniſter above cited ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly: that Charity is the moſt precious grace of God; and is the greateſt mean &amp; inſtrument of our Iuſtification. And that he (meaning Calvin) who preferreth faith before charity in our Iuſtification, would elude S. Pauls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
               <p>But, there is another part or branch of this third errour, much more dangerous then the former. For, as they teach that faith alone doth iuſtify, and yet they require with it charity &amp; other vertues, which makes the difference to be more nominal then real; ſo they teach that this iuſtifying faith is nothing elſe, but a ſure perſuaſion, that every one ought to have of the forgiveneſſe of his ſins, for the merits of Chriſt; and that he is iuſt in the ſight of God. This is the ſpecial faith, which they ſay is only given to the elect; and theſe, who once have it, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43743:101"/> fall from it; and they are ſure of their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; predeſtination. In this matter, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians differ ſubſtantially from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; who require alſo faith to Iuſtification, but of a far different nature from this of Calvin; which they eſteem not to be faith, but rather a phanatical fancy, and high preſumption. Againſt which, I found ſome ſolid reaſons which I will briefly touch. 1. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to believe any thing, as an article of faith, but that which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vealed. But God hath not revealed, that every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſins are forgiven him. Therefore he ought not to believe it, &amp; much leſſe: although he believe it, is he iuſtifyed by it. 2. There is neither precept nor example in the whole Scripture, of ſuch a ſpecial iuſtifying faith. Therefore it is not to be admitted. 3. It is far different from the faith of Abraham, the father of the faithfull, by which he was iuſtifyed; which faith, the Apoſtle in the ſame epiſtle to the Romans, doth highly extoll. For he was iuſtifyed, by believing the promiſe of God, which was revealed to him, to witt: that he should be the Father of many nations, and that his ſeed should be as the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the heauen, and the ſand of the ſea. This is the faith which the Chriſtians of all ages, ever required, before Luther &amp; Calvin aroſe, to believe what God had revealed, to witt: the articles of our Creed, and the other matters contaynd in Scripture: accorording to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>If thou confeſſe with thy mouth our Lord Ieſus,</hi>

For experience hath proved,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43743:102"/> that it hath made diverſe to be troubled in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and looſe their wits: and ſome to fall into deſpaire, by putting violent hands in themſelves; as it did not long ago, to a famous Covenanter in Aberdeen,<note place="margin">M. T. Mercer.</note> who drowned himſelf, when he was eſteem'd by the Miniſters there, to haue been at the very point, of getting aſſurance of his election. So that I have heard ſome of the old Proteſtant Miniſters condemne much this iuſtifying faith of the Puritans.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Shel. p.</hi> 36.38.</note> And M. Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford doth not ſtand, to call it, <hi>a private Fancie,</hi> and a <hi>falſe faith;</hi> and an enemy to all true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; piety. Therefore, by Gods grace, I do not intend to believe it, much leſſe to found my Salvation vpon it. All the aſſurance that we can have here, without Gods particular revelation, is by hope in the divine goodneſſe, and mercy: which hope is not only fufficient to comfort vs in this life, but alſo, it will not confound vs in the next; if we ſtrive here to do our dutie: and have the love of God, powred forth in our hearts. Therefore, it belongs to the vertue of hope, and not to faith, to apply the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; as the ſame M. Shelford doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Beſids all theſe authorities &amp; reaſons: a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique shew me that this doctrin of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith only, deſtroyeth it ſelf. For if we cannot be iuſtifyed by any works, then we could not be iuſtifyed by faith, ſince faith it ſelf is a work, according to theſe words of our Saviour: <hi>This is the work of God, that you beleeve in him, whom he hath ſent.</hi> Therefore, ſaid he, ſince we are iuſtifyed by faith, which is not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43743:102"/> againſt the divine grace, nor our free iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; becauſe faith it ſelf is a work of grace: ſo we may be alſo Iuſtifyed by love, hope, and other works of grace; without any derogation from the diuine grace. He did further vrge and ſaid: either the faith, by which the Calviniſts ſay, that men are iuſtifyed, is a mortal ſin, or not? If it be a deadly ſin; then they are iuſtifyed by ſin: which is impious to ſay. If it be not a mortal ſin: then all our actions are not ſins, as Luther &amp; Calvin falſly teach. The ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique shew me, that, to shun theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, to which the doctrin of the Calviniſts drives them; they affirm, that faith, albeit it be a work, yet it doth not iuſtify, as a work of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: but only as an Inſtrument, to apprehend the iuſtice of Chriſt. Calvin ſaith: that <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cal. ib. <hi>3.</hi> Instit. cap. <hi>11.</hi> ſect. <hi>7.</hi> Mel. in locis tit. de bon. oper.</note> 
                  <hi>although it be of no dignity nor price, iuſtifyes vs, bringing Chriſt, as a pot filled with money enricheth a man.</hi> Melanchton ſaith: that iuſtifying faith, is like a poore mans hand, which he ſtretcheth forth, to receive almes, from a rich man. And ſo at length, this iuſtifying faith, which the Presbyterians ſo much cry vp, by the confeſſion of Calvin, is of no price nor dignity; ſo that by him it is compared to <hi>a pot</hi> and by another great light, to a <hi>ſcabbed mans' hand:</hi> and by both ther principles, it is a <hi>ſinfull inſtrument,</hi> by which they will have all men to be iuſtifyed. Whereby (ſaid the Catholique) it may appeare, that theſe men are no leſſe enemies to faith, then to works, and that they deſtroy the goodneſſe &amp; vertue of both. Whereas the Catholiques do
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43743:103"/> eſteem faith, to be an excellent vertue, and the very roote &amp; foundation of our Iuſtification.</p>
               <p>There was an other difficulty, ariſing clearly from the Presbyterian doctrin; with which the ſame Catholique did much preſſe me, and ſome other Proteſtants, who were preſent. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid he, the Presbyterians, who pretend to be aſſured of their electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are purged &amp; cleanſed from the filthines of their ſins, befor they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into heauen: or they are not purged at all from them? If they be not purged from them: Then they cannot enter into that heavenly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For S. Iohn ſaith: <hi>There shall not enter into it any polluted thing.</hi> That citie is deſcribed to be of pure gold, and the foundations of it, to be adorned with every precious ſtone. Therefore the Citizens of it, muſt alſo be pure and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout ſpot. And conſequently: if the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, be not purged from the filthineſſe and ſores of their ſins; which muſt not be only covered; but really taken away, cured, and cleanſed: they cannot enter into heaven. If they ſay, that they muſt be purged from their ſins, and all filthineſſe and blots taken from them, before they can enter into heaven; then they are either purged from their ſins, in this life, or in the life to come. Not in this: becauſe they teach, that their ſins are not taken away in this life; but are only covered, and the filthineſſe of them remaines; and as they live, ſo they di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in ſins. Not after this life: for then, they beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to acknowledge a Purgatory; which is againſt a principal article of their negative faith.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43743:103"/> If they ſay; their ſins are taken away by death, in the very inſtant of it: Then ſince death is common to all men; if death had that power, all men would be cleanſed from ſin; and ſo all would be ſaved; which is falſe. If they ſay, It is not death ſimply, but death ioyn'd with faith, that hath this power. Why shall not alſo, faith and life have the ſame power? How can the Preſbyterians, without any ground in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, aſſigne that power to faith, and death; which they deny, againſt Scripture, to faith, and the holy Sacraments, and to the blood of Chriſt? Death indeed, may put an end to ſin; that one ſin no more: but it cannot take away ſins already done: or elſe death would be more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull, according to that tenet, then the blood of Chriſt, &amp; the holy Sacraments; which is not only a groundleſſe fancy, but alſo a great abſurdity. Out of which, it followeth that either the Presbyterians muſt grant, that they do not go to heaven; which is very much againſt the aſſurance of their election: or that they are purged from their ſins, after this life, ſince they are not purged in it: which is againſt their negative confeſſion. And ſo theſe, who deny a a Purgatory for venial ſins, muſt grant a new and moſt dangerous Purgatory, for mortal ſins. For my part: I could never find a ſolid anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to this reaſon; and therefore I leave it to the Preſbyteries conſideration.</p>
               <p>But, becauſe this Catholique did trouble vs, with this difficulty; I thought to have entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled him as much, with the words of Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43743:104"/> whereof I had heard ſome Miniſtera of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten boaſt. Did not Bellarmin, ſaid I, after he had much laboured, to prove Iuſtification by works, in end conclude: <hi>That, it was moſt ſafe to put all our confidence, in the only mercy of God.</hi> What will become then of all your works and merits; which ſuch a great Champion, of your Church, doth renounce? To which he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: that Bellarmins words fully related, do clear the whole matter:<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 5. de Iuſtif. cap. <hi>7.</hi> prop. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> and shew the vanity of the Miniſters pretences. For thus he ſpeaks. <hi>By reaſon of the vncertainty of our proper Iuſtice, and of the danger of our vaine glory, it is moſt ſafe, to put all our confidence in the only mercy &amp; favour of God.</hi> Where he doth not deny, neither good works nor merits: but only, affirmeth, that for two reaſons, which he there toucheth, that it is moſt ſafe, not to rely vpon them: but vpon the alone mercy of God. Out of which, the Miniſters would make this falſe collection: the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore we are not iuſtifyed by works. Which is as ridiculous, as if you would ſay. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants teach: that it is moſt ſafe, to rely vpon the mercy of God: Therefore they are not iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed by faith. If then the Proteſtants relying vpon the mercy of God, taketh not away Iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by faith: why should not alſo the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques relying on the ſame mercy, not take away Iuſtification by works? Bellarmin ſpeaks ſo clearly in this matter, that his meaning can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wreſted without malice. For he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, in the ſame place, that David, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints, had ſome confidence in their iuſtice
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43743:104"/> and good works: according to that in the 17. Pſalme: <hi>The Lord will render to me according to my iuſtice: becauſe I have kept his wayes.</hi> The like he sheweth of Nehemias, Ezechias, and Eſter. And this they did, with great humility. But, becauſe ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is dangerous to many, by reaſon of pride &amp; vaine glory, that may ariſe: &amp; beſide there are few, who haue ſuch merits, or are ſure to have them: Therefore Bellarmin ſaith: it is moſt ſafe, to rely on the mercy of God: whereof he gives this reaſon. Either a man hath good works: or he hath none, but evil works. If he hath no good, but evil works; then he is perniciouſly deceived, who truſts in evil works: for theſe are <hi>deceitfull riches.</hi> as S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nard calls them. If he hath good works: he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth nothing by not looking on them, &amp; by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his truſt in the mercy of God alone: for God lookes on them, &amp; knowes them well, and will not ſuffer them to paſſe, without their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Thus Bellarmin. Yea,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. ſeſſ. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> the Councel of Trent makes the like profeſſion, when it ſaith: <hi>Although much be given to good works, in the holy Scriptures: &amp;c. Yet God forbid, that a Chriſtian should truſt or glory in himſelf, &amp; not in our Lord: whoſe goodneſſe is ſo great, that he willeth theſe things, to be our merits, which are his own gifts.</hi> The Miniſters may collect, out of theſe words, by their Logique, that the Councel of Trent, yea and that all Papiſts are Proteſtants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they will not diſtinguish, between the neceſſity of good works; and confiding in them: which are very different. At leaſt, all moderat Proteſtants may
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43743:105"/> know by this open profeſſion, the falshood of that calumny, which is often beaten into their eares, to witt, that all Papiſts preſume in their merits. S. Auguſtin sheweth, that there are two gulfs in this matter, one vpon either hand: and that the truth is a direct way in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Preſumption of iuſtice, or good works, is the gulf, vpon the one hand: and negligence of good works, is the precipice on the other. But the earneſt care of good works and piety, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with humility, is the ſafe way in the middle. Thus ended the Catholique, to the good ſatisfaction of ſome Proteſtants, who were preſent.</p>
               <p>To conclude this matter, (wherein I have ſtayed longer, by reaſon of the Miniſters ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences of great advantage in it) I can not believe any more, <hi>Iuſtification by faith only,</hi> as the principal article of my religion: becauſe it is not in Sctipture: becauſe it is expreſly againſt Scripture, &amp; againſt the holy Fathers: becauſe it is an ancient hereſy, condemned in Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, &amp; Eunomius: becauſe the Presbyteria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, is not a true Catholique faith, having the divin reveal'd truth for its obiect, as theſe he retiques required: but is a private fancy &amp; a falſe faith,<note place="margin">Shelf. aboue.</note> (as it is acknowledged by ſome Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts) having for its obiect, humane preſumption. Becauſe it makes Chriſt a moſt imperfect Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician: and either debarreth man, from the kingdome of heaven, into which he cannot enter with the filthineſſe of his ſins; or expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, after this life, to a moſt dangerous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43743:105"/> Becauſe it breeds neglect of all piety, and good works: and opens a wide gate to all ſort of vice. In a word: albeit the Miniſters brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged much of this article: yet I found they had never leſſe reaſon: if we will ſtand to the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment of the Scriptures &amp; Fathers: which, God willing, I ever intend to prefer to their fancies, and to their Philoſophical diſtinctions, or rather confuſions: to which, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to run: that they may lurk in their obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when they are beaten out of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: in which, at firſt, they pretended, to be impregnably ſetled. It is ſufficient for me, that the Scripture expreſly ſaith: that a man is <hi>iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by works, and not by faith only;</hi> Which is the contradiction of the Preſbyterians faith: and that themſelves do acknowledge in end, the neceſſity of good works. But to know how they are neceſſary; either as cauſes, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not a neceſſary curioſity; wherof few are capable, and without which many have gone to heaven. And ſo now, I proceed to the Trial of our doctrin, concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>AS I knew the Chriſtian religion, to be the moſt excellent, of all true religions, that ever have been: whether we conſider that, which was vnder the law of nature, or the other which was vnder the law of Moyſes: ſo I iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly conceived, that it was moſt agreeable to Gods goodneſſe and wiſdome, to adorne and enrich it, with moſt excellent Sacraments. For, ſince no religion, whether true or falſe, can be without ſome ſenſible ſignes,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>19.</hi> cont. Fauſt. cap. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> as S.

And ſo I found, the ſame S. Auguſtin, extolling the perfection of the Chriſtian Sacraments, above theſe of the ancient law.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de doct.

                  <hi>Our Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical diſciplin haue delivered ſome few Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for many; and theſe moſt eaſy to be done, moſt magnificent for ſignification, and moſt pure to be obſerved.</hi> And elſwhere, he ſaith: <hi>the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menss are changed, they are made eaſier, fewer hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſommer, happier.</hi> Now the principal perfection of the Chriſtian Sacraments, was generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43743:106"/> to conſiſt in this; that God, by them, did conferre grace vnto our ſoules. Which truth is ſo engrafted in the hearts of Chriſtians, that I knew diverſe Proteſtants, could not be at firſt perſwaded, that Luther, or Calvin, or that their Church, taught the contrary: and. when that was ſufficiently manifeſted to them; they were much ſcandalized at it: In ſo much, that ſome of them did ſay: If the Sacraments do not confer grace, and baptiſme doth not take away original ſin; for what vſe ſerve the Sacraments: for what end were they ordain'd?</p>
               <p>Wherefore, being thus ſtirred vp to try this queſtion, I found in end, that the Catholique doctrine, which taught that the Sacraments of the new Law do confer grace, is conformable to the divine Scriptures; that it was expreſly believed by the holy Fathers; and doth duly exalt the perfection of the Chriſtian Sacraments: Whereas the Presbyterians doctrin; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth the Sacraments to confer grace, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe againſt the Scriptures; but was alſo condemned, as an ancient hereſy, by the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that it vndervalues the vertue of the Chriſtian Sacraments: and is ſo abſurd, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe famous Proteſtants haue abandoned that opinion, albeit it was taught both by Luther &amp; Calvin; and in this point do agree with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques. All which things, for brevities ſake, I will only touch.</p>
               <p>Of Baptiſme, S. Iohn ſaid to the Iewes:<note place="margin">3.11. <hi>Math.</hi>

Paul calleth alſo Baptiſme, <hi>the Lauer of regeneration, by which we are ſaved.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt hath ſanctifyed his Church, by the lauer of water; in the word of life.</hi> By which teſtimonies, albeit we ſpeak nothing of many others, it appear'd ſufficiently clear to me: ſince we are ſaid, to have our ſins washed away by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; to be ſanctifyed: to be born of new again: that by it we receive alſo grace, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout which, theſe things could not be verified, and performed. The like is alſo affirmed of the Euchariſt, of which our Saviour ſaith: <hi>If any man eate of this bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.51.54.</note> 
                  <hi>he shall live for ever.</hi> And again <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath everlaſting life.</hi> Now this everlaſting life, is no otherwiſe had here, but by receiving Grace, which is the ſeed of Glory, and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life &amp; happineſſe. Therefore theſe two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which are all, that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians admit, do confer grace by the vertue &amp; inſtitution of Chriſt,</p>
               <p>What was the belief of the holy Fathers, and of the whole Church, in this point, it is ſo clear; that Calvin himſelf, and other chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do acknowledge it to be the ſame, which is now believed by the Catholiques, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their doctrin.<note place="margin">Cal. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Inſtit. cap. <hi>14.</hi> ſect. <hi>14.</hi> &amp; <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> For. Calvin confeſſeth, that with great conſent, it was taught and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved for many ages; That the Sacraments of the new Law do confer grace, if they were not hindered by mortal ſin; which, albeit he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43743:107"/> a pernicious and peſtilentious opinion, and alleadgeth, that it drawes men from God, to reſt in the ſight of corporall things, and not in God himſelf; yet he confeſſeth alſo, that it was taught by S. Auguſtin, &amp; the holy Fathers: whom he ſtriveth to excuſe, by ſaying, that in their immoderat praiſes of the Sacraments,<note place="margin">Cent. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; cent. <hi>3.</hi> c <hi>4.</hi> Muſcul. in loc. com. p. <hi>299.</hi>
                  </note> they vſed hyperbolical ſpeeches. The Lutheran Centuriſts do aſcribe the ſame doctrin, as an errour, to the moſt ancient Fathers: as to S. Clement, Iuſtin, Cyprian, and others. Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus ſaith plainly: <hi>that Auguſtin did rashly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the Sacraments of the new law confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red grace.</hi> Theſe open confeſſions shall ſave our paines, of citing the Fathers teſtimonies. And that this doctrin of the Catholiques doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the perfection of the Chriſtian Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is ſo clear of it ſelf, that it needeth no illuſtration. Vpon this conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, S.

Thus much briefly, to shew that I found the Catholique doctrin to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Scriptures &amp; holy Fathers, and to manifeſt the perfection of the Chriſtian Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therfore Calvins opinion, which is iuſt contrary, muſt needs be againſt all theſe.

That it taketh away a great perfection from the Sacraments, denying them to conferre grace, is ſo evident, that it needs no proofe. Calvin ſaw this ſo clearly, that he pretended, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhers vſed immoderate praiſes of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that this vertue, which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques do aſcribe to the Sacraments, makes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to truſt more in creatures, them in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But as I found Calvins doctrin to be falſe; ſo I ſoone perceived, that his pretence of preſerving Gods honour, was very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For how can the vertue of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments derogate from the power &amp; honour of Chriſt; ſince all power &amp; vertue, that they have, is acknowledged to be from Chriſt, who is the principall Agent and Author of grace, they being only the inſtruments, by which he produceth it? How can the vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments draw people from God, and make them rely more on corporal things then on God: ſince it, being ſo ſpiritual and ſupernatural, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drawes people from corporal things to God, and makes them to admire more his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer &amp; to love his goodneſſe? This was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the vertue of the Sacraments produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in S. Auguſtin; when with admiration he cryed out: <hi>Whence hath the water that vertue, that it toucheth the body &amp; cleanſeth the ſoule.</hi> A Catholique did further illuſtrate this matter to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43743:108"/> me, by an example. VVho can be ſo void of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (ſaid he) as to think, that the vertue, which proceeded from the hemme of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours garment, by touching whereof,<note place="margin">

And was not the woman &amp; all the people preſent, drawen the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby more cloſely to Chriſt, and made to love his goodneſſe, and admire his power? It is iuſt ſo in the Sacraments. As that vertue, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the hemne of our Saviours gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cured ſupernaturally the deſeaſe of the body; ſo the vertue, which proceeds from the Sacraments, cures the deſeaſes and infirmities of the ſoule.

When it was obiected to Luther by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, that the Sacrament of baptiſme could not ſtirre vp faith in infants baptized, who have no vſe of reaſon: he was brought to that ſtraight, that he ſaid infants did actually beleeve

                  </note> who affirm ſuch things, do an iniurie to humane ſenſes.

Which doctrin gives great advantage to the Anabaptiſts, and sheweth, that the baptiſm of infants is not profitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they attayne to the vſe of reaſon. So that, according to the chieff Proteſtant Reformers, the Sacraments are nothing but badges, or bare ſignes &amp; tokens, or ſeales of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, without any inward effect of grace.

               <p>There was one doubt, which I had in this matter, concerning that which the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques teach, that the Sacraments do conferre grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> or by the work wrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght. For I have heard ſome Miniſters affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Papiſts intended thereby to shew, that the Sacraments produced grace, as well in thoſe, who were evil diſpoſed, and came wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout due preparation, as in thoſe who were well diſpoſed, and came well prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them: which I iuſtly eſteem'd to be moſt falſe and impious. Therefore, having propoſed this difficulty to a Catholique; I was informed by him, that this was a meer calumny of the Miniſters;<note place="margin">Luther. de capt. Baſil. cap. de Bapt. Cal. in Antid. ſeſſ. <hi>7.</hi> can. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> wherein they followed their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, Luther &amp; Calvin, who ſaid; that to conferre grace, by the work wrought, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Catholiques, was nothing elſe, but to conferre grace to a ſinner, without faith and repentance. But the Catholiques, ſaid he, have no ſuch falſe and abſurd meaning. They only, by that phraſe do shew, that the grace, which Chriſt produceth by the Sacraments, as by his inſtruments, doth not depend either vpon the the holynes of the Miniſter, or vpon worthineſſe of the receiver, but vpon the work wrought, that is, on the Sacramental action, which is inſtituted by Chriſt, for that end. As for example; the Sacrament of baptiſme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the grace of Sanctification to infants, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing away their original ſin, and making them the children of God; and this effect it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly produceth in infants, in whom no
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43743:110"/> diſpoſitions are required: ſo that, if they die, before they commit any actual ſin: all of them would infallibly go to heaven. Here it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that baptiſme confers grace, by the work wrought, or by the Sacramental action and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, and not, for any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the infants. Again, although the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of faith, love, repentance and the reſt, be required in theſe perſons, who, being come to age, are to be baptized; yet baptiſme doth produce their Sanctification, not by vertue, or for the merit of theſe diſpoſitions, (although, without them, iuſtifying grace would not be produced) but for the inſtitution of Chriſt, to whom, and not to the merit of the receaver, all the grace is attributed. Thus he shew me, how the Catholique Doctours did explaine the matter, and that it never entered into any of their heads, that the Sacraments would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce grace in thoſe, who were ill diſpoſed, or received the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without due preparation; ſince the Scripture sheweth, that theſe,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note> who receeive the Euchariſt vnworthily, receive vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnation.</p>
               <p>Vpon theſe conſiderations, I thought it no wonder, that the Preſbyterians, who eſteem their Sacraments to be of ſo little value, haue alſo made them to be of ſo little vſe. For they haue abrogated and condemned all private bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and Communion; ſo, that theſe two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which are all they have, cannot be any more vſed in private, although vpon never ſo great neceſſity. And, for their Communion,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43743:111"/> as they never give it in private, for the comfort of the ſick ſo they give it very ſeldom in publick, for the devotion of the whole: for in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Townes, and other parts of the Countrey, it hath not been once adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe 8. or 9. yeares. By all which, I ſaw clearly enough, that the doctrines and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of the Preſbyterians, were not only againſt the excellency, but alſo againſt the neceſſity of the Chriſtian Sacraments; which were thereby rendred altogether graceleſſe, and almoſt vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Therefore I intended Godwilling, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no longer ſuch wicked opinions and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes: which deſtroy the nature, end, and vſe of the Chriſtian Sacraments.</p>

But now, let vs heare the iudgment of the holy Fathers, &amp; of the primitive Church.</p>
               <p>S.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Theſe Manichees do teach, that

For we teach, that baptiſm gives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all ſins, and takes away crimes, and not shaveth them.</hi> Where may be obſerved, not only what was the doctrin of the auncient Church, but alſo that the contrary, is a point of the Manichean hereſy; and that theſe, who maintain it, are infidels, in S. Auguſtins iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Again, the ſame holy Father sheweth the great vertue of baptiſm, when he ſaith:<note place="margin">Aug. lib <hi>1.</hi> de peccat. mer. &amp; rcmiſ. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>by the begetting flesh, original ſin is only contracted: but by the regenerating Spirit, remiſsion is made not only of original, but alſo the of voluntary ſins.</hi> S. Chryſoſtom doth more largely illuſtrate this matter, shewing, that baptiſm doth not only take away ſin, but alſo bringeth many graces, &amp; privileges to the perſons baptized. <hi>They are,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chryſ, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. ad Neophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</note> ſaith he, <hi>not only made free, but holy: not only holy, but iuſt: not only iuſt, but children: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, but heires: not only heires, but bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Chriſt: not only brethren of Chriſt, but coheires: not only coheires, but memhers: not only the temple, but the members of the Spirit.

And leaſt this should be thought, to be ſaid out of ambition or exaggeration; he proves all from theſe words of S. Paul.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10.11.</note>

Clement,<note place="margin">Cent. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; cent. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> S. Iuſtin, Cyprian, and many others, maintain'd the ſame doctrine. Yea they maintain'd this ſo eagerly, that ſome of them do brand thoſe, who believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, with the note of infidelity: as we have ſeen lately out of S. Auguſtin.<note place="margin">Greg. lib. <hi>9.</hi> regiſt. ep. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> To whom alſo accordeth S. Gregory the great, who ſaith: that nothing can be more vnfaithfull, then to,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43743:113"/> teach, that ſins are only ſuperficially, or not fully, taken away in baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Moreover: this truth is ſo engrafted in the hearts of Chriſtians, that the moſt part of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants believes it, albeit it be againſt the faith of their Church, and albeit it be alſo true, that few of them know ſo much. Hence it came to paſſe, that diverſe Presbyterians were ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized at ſome words, which a great Apoſtle of the Covenant ſpake lately, againſt this truth. For when one, ſtriving to cleare himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Presbytery, of ſome imputation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith he was charged, had ſaid, that he was as innocent of that, whereof he was accuſed, as he was free of original ſin, by baptiſme: the ſaid Apoſtle preſently took him vp sharply, &amp; told him; that he was ſpeaking flat Popery, and that neither he, nor any man whoſoever would be freed from original ſin, ſo long as they lived. Wherevpon, many, to whoſe eares this diſcourſe came, took great offence, as if this had been the private opinion of that Miniſter, not knowing that it was alſo the belief of the Presbyterian Church, and of their firſt Reformers. Hence it may appeare, that this article of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian faith, is not only againſt the Scriptures, &amp; holy Fathers: but alſo againſt the very inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct of almoſt all Chriſtians And beſids all theſe abſurdities, I found it to have been a moſt auncient hereſy, defended by the Origeniſts: who thought, as S.

And if they die, they may be ſaved without baptiſm. And, according to this doctrin, he made a law in Geneva, that the children to be baptized, should expect ſermon; and he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a child to dye without baptiſme; becauſe it was brought, a little late, to the Church; as Florimond Reymond teſtifyeth.</p>

               <p>Moreover, it was condemned,<note place="margin">Aug. lib de haereſ. c. <hi>69.</hi>
                  </note> as an old hereſy in the Pelagians. For they denyed alſo, that baptiſm was neceſſary for the remiſſion of original ſin. There is indeed this difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween them, &amp; the Presbyterians: that they, denying original ſin, thought it not neceſſary for the remiſſion of it; albeit they eſteem'd it neceſſary, for the attayning the kingdom of heaven. But the Presbyterians, graunting ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin, believe, that baptiſm is neither neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the remiſſion of it; nor for obtaining of heaven: and ſo their errour, in this point is greater, then that of the Pelagians. For they promiſe the kingdom of heaven to children dying without baptiſm: which the Pelagians preſumed not to do: it being ſo clearly againſt the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>That diverſe famous Proteſtants have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donned this errour, and do hold, that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not promiſed to the children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, dying without baptiſm, Breirly sheweth in the Proteſtants Apology:<note place="margin">Prot, Apol. trac. <hi>3.</hi> ſect. <hi>4.</hi> n. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> where he cites for this purpoſe, the Confeſſion of Auxburg, Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus Regius, Hoſmanus, Bilſon Biſhop of Wincheſter, and others. King Iames alſo, in the conference at Hampton-Court, maintain'd that baptiſm was neceſſarie, by the neceſſity of command; albeit he did not think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, by the neceſſitie of means. All which conſiderations, were more then ſufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to make me abandon the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian opinion, and to embrace the Catholique
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43743:117"/> belief concerning the neceſſity of haptiſm, for the Salvation of infants.</p>
               <p>But, finding that the Preſbyterians have principally two exceptions, againſt the ancient Catholique doctrin, I propoſed them to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, for my greater ſatisfaction. Firſt, ſaid I, the Preſbyterians do alleadge, that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of baptiſm is againſt the power of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by tying him to the ordinary means. 2. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that it is againſt his mercy, to exclude ſo many children from the kingdom of heaven. And therefore, in their Covenant, they accuſe you, who are Catholiques, of cruel iudgment, againſt children, dying without baptiſm. To which the Catholique anſwered, that theſe pretences were frivolous. For firſt, ſaid he, that cannot be againſt Gods power, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his divine will, by which his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is in ſome kind limited. Now, God, whoſe power is infinit, and who might ſave children by many other means, then by baptiſm, hath declared his will; th t, <hi>vnleſſe a man be borne again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven;</hi> and therefore, ſo much as we know by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd will, he hath appointed no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for original ſin, but baptiſm; which, being determinated by Gods proper will, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be againſt his power. Neither is God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by tyed to any ordinary means; but to ſuch, wherevnto he hath freely determinated himſelf, according to his will. Vpon which only will of God, and his divin inſtitution, and not vpon the fancy &amp; ſpeculation of man, do depend the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43743:117"/> remedies, which are neceſſarie, for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of infants. Now, Gods will and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be knowen, but by the divin revelation: and God hath reveal'd no other remedie, but baptiſm. Therefore, as the Catholiques do well, by grounding their faith, on the divin revelation; and by vſeing all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, to apply the remedie, which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt for the Salvation of infants; ſo the Preſbyterians do ill, by founding their faith, in this point, not vpon the Scriptures, but vpon vncertain coniectures, which are alſo againſt the Scriptures: and they do alſo ill, by neglecting the remedie ordain'd by God, to expoſe the Salvation of infants to meer vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties. S. Auguſtin ſaith excellently to this purpoſe: <hi>Let not according to our fancy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. lib. de pec. mer. &amp; remiſ. c. <hi>32.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>eternal ſalvation be promiſed to infants, dying without the baptiſm of Chriſt, which the divin Scriptures, preferable to all humane ingines, do not promiſe.</hi> Secondly, the Catholique ſaid that the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians ſpeak not conſequentially, when they ſay, that Gods power should not be tyed to the ordinary means. For, by this phraſe, they would make people believe: that they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd baptiſm the ordinarie mean of taking away, or of pardoninng original ſin: which indeed they do not. For they teach with Calvin, that original ſin is taken away before baptiſm, which doth not, according to them, purge or forgive ſin: but is only a ſcale of ſin already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. And therefore, the Preſbyterians, in this matter, both contradict themſelves, and would deceive others.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:43743:118"/>
               <p>Next, the ſame Catholique shew me, that the Preſbyterians, by their other pretence, would ſeem to plead for the mercy of God, as they did by the firſt, for his power; but with a like bad ſucceſſe; and that they, very vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, accuſe the Catholiques iudgment. For it is no crueltie to conform our iudgments to the iudgment of God, which we know by his own revelation. Gods iudgments, although they be ſometimes ſo ſecret, that we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes penetrate into the true cauſes of them; yet it is moſt certain, that they are ever iuſt; and therefore, not cruell. But, as in this matter, Gods iudgment is clearly reveal'd; ſo it is very eaſy to find the cauſe of it; to witt, original ſin: which, as it was contracted by generation from Adam; ſo it muſt be purged, and taken away by regeneration in Chriſt; or elſe he, who is truth it ſelf, ſaith, that none can enter into the kingdom of heaven. Beſides: the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques iudgment againſt infants, dying, wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hout baptiſm, is not ſo cruel, as the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians iudgment is cruel againſt many children, dying with baptiſm. For the more common ſentence of Catholique Divines is, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dying without baptiſm are not troubled with any ſenſible paine, but that they are only excluded, for want of it, from the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall happineſſe, which the baptized enioy in heaven; and that otherwiſe, they leade a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie life But the Preſbyterians, in their new confeſſion, teach that all children baptized, are not vndoubtedly regenerated: to which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43743:118"/> that many infants baptiſed are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as not belonging to the Covenant of grace: which Bucer did expreſſe more clearly,<note place="margin">Bucer in cap. <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>3.</hi> Math.</note> when he ſaith, that <hi>children predeſtinate are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without baptiſm; and the not predeſtinate are damned even with baptiſm.</hi> Now, I enquire which of theſe two iudgments is more cruell? To ſay: that children, dying without baptiſm, do not enter into heaven, but yet they ſuffer no ſenſible paine: or to ſay that many children, dying with baptiſm, are not only excluded from heaven, but are alſo eternally tormented in hell, with ſenſible paines? Without all doubt the laſt; which is the iudgment of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, is incomparably more cruell. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is more rigorous, then the iudgment of theſe other Catholiques Divines, who teach, that infants dying without baptiſm, are not only excluded from heaven, but are condemned to hell, and to ſome ſenſible paines therein, for the ſame reaſon. For it is more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, without doubt, to condemne, to hells ſenſible paines, ſome infants that are baptized, and ſome that are not; then to iudge, that the only not baptized children are liable to that paine. By this it may be ſeen, that the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who accuſe others falſly of cruell iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, againſt children dying without baptiſm, are guilty themſelves of more cruell iudgement againſt children, dying with baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But, albeit, ſaid he, the Catholiques iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this matter were falſe or cruell, as the Preſbyterians do alleadge; yet there followeth
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43743:119"/> no cruelty nor inconuenience vpon it, to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are thereby, with the greater care and commiſeration, carried in all haſte to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. So that this pretended cruelty in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, produceth true mercy &amp; compaſſion in action. But if the Preſbyterians doctrine be falſe, as it muſt be, if the criptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fathers &amp; Councels be true, great evils and cruelties follow vpon it to the children. Fot thereby, many of them are ſuffered to die without bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and ſo are cruelly deprived of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Theſe mens pretended mercy in Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, produceth reall cruelty in their actions. Thus he, in anſwer to my doubts.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ſame Catholique shew me, that according to the Catholique Doctours, the baptiſm of infants may be ſupplyed by Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is alſo called baptiſm in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as when our Saviour ſaid to the children of Zebedee:<note place="margin">

And, according to this doctrin, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did handſomly diſtinguish three kinds of baptiſm, which they called <hi>Sanguinis, flaminis, &amp; fluminis:</hi> that is, the baptiſm of blood, of the Spirit, &amp; of water.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he ſaid, that although baptiſm were not a neceſſarie mean, ordained by God, for Salvation of Infants; yet it hath the neceſſitie of a command to Paſtors,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.</note> as is evident by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words to the Apoſtles: <hi>Goe and teach all nations, baptizeing them &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, although it were ſuppoſed, that no hurt come to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, dying without baptiſm; yet they, who by their office are obliged to baptize, commit a great ſin, when they wilfully neglect to obey Chriſts command: which the Preſbyterian Paſtors manifeſtly do, ſuffering ſo many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, notwithſtanding the many teares and cries of their parents, to die without baptiſm. And, according to this obſervation, King Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes anſwered well a Miniſter in Scotland, who enquired of him, if he thought baptiſm ſo neceſſarie, that, if it were omitted, the child would be damned. No ſaid the King, but I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, if yow, being called to baptiſe a child in danger of death, would refuſe to do it,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43743:120"/> that you would be damned. This anſwer may be ſeen, in the firſt dayes conference at Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court. Where it is alſo shewed, that ſuch a neglect of, baptiſme is not only a damnable ſin, in the Miniſter, but likwiſe that it is very da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous for the child. For who, ſaith the Bishop of London, hath any car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Who would not rather aſſure his action, vpon the promiſes of Ieſus Chriſt; then the omiſſion of it, vpon the ſecret iudgment of God? Then, whereas the Miniſters do allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge that Chriſts command extends only to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique, and not to private baptiſm, this is a meer fancy without any ground in Scripture, where no ſuch diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made: yea it is againſt Scripture. For do we not read, that S. Paul was baptized privatly by Ananias, and the Eunuch by S. Philip.<note place="margin">

Moreover, he sheweth, how in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Synod, at Figear, it was ordain'd, that the Miniſters should comfort the parents of children dying without baptiſm But all in vaine: ſo that the Miniſters of Poictou, in an aſlembly at Chaſtelrauld in the yeare 1599. were enforced to give way to Miniſters, to baptize in private houſes, that they might avoid the cryes of tender hearted mothers. I have heard of ſome pittiful accidents that have fallen forth in our Countrey, vpon this ſame occaſion: ſo that ſome mothers have almoſt gone out of their witts, when the Miniſters ſuffered their children to die without baptiſm.

                  </note> And its knowen alſo that the Preſbyterians do zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly maintaine, that Chriſts body is only in the heavens, and that it is impoſſible even to the omnipotency of God, to make a body to be preſent in two places at once. And therefore, according to them, Chriſts body cannot be really preſent in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Although this be a moſt important queſtion, and is much agitated by the curioſity of carnal reaſon; yet I was ſoone ſatisfyed in it; becauſe I was reſolved by Gods grace, to found my faith vpon no other ground, but vpon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scriptures, as they were vnderſtood by the ancient Church &amp; holy Fathers. And therefore, after a little diligence and ſome conference with a Catholique, on this matter; I found, that the reall preſence of Chriſts body in the Sacrament was conforme to the clear words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were ſo vnderſtood by the holy Fathers, and which, in right reaſon, cannot be otherwiſe vnderſtood; and that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this truth by famous miracles. And,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43743:122"/> vpon the other part, I found, that the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erian doctrin is againſt Scriptures, Fathers, Councels and right reaſon, that it is an ancient hereſy, and ſo falſe, that many Proteſtants do eagerly oppoſe it: and laſtly, that ſuch great confuſion was in this matter, among the firſt Apoſtles of this new religion; that it is no wonder to ſee it ſo much multiplied among their children. All which points I will briefly touch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Catholiques bring expreſſe Scripture for the reall preſence, to witt the words of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this holy Sacrament, related by three Evangeliſts and one Apoſtle: where our Saviour alwayes ſaith, This is my body. This is my blood. And to know that he mean'd of his true &amp; reall body, he adioyneth my body, which shall be given for you, and my blood which shall be shed for you. Now it was his reall body, which was given for them, and his reall blood which was shed for them.<note place="margin">S. Iohn. ch. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was his reall body, &amp; reall blood, which they received in the Sacrament. Moreover, S. Iohn relateth along diſcourſe, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had to the Iewes, in which he affirmes, that he was <hi>the bread of life, that came down from heaven.</hi> And the bread, which he was to give, was <hi>his flesh,</hi> for the life of the world: and vnleſſe they eate his flesh, and drink his blood, they should have no life in them. And, notwitſtanding that the Iewes murmured at all theſe things, ſaying: <hi>How can this man give vs his flesh to eate! and this is a hard ſaying, who
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43743:122"/> can heare it?</hi> Yet our Saviour did with many aſſeverations affirm it, over and over again: yea and the ſuffered them to depart from him, becauſe they would not believe this divine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. Now Chriſt is not a mocker or deceiver of men, to ſpeak one thing, yea and to averre it with aſſeverations, which are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to oaths: and to intend the contrary. Chriſt is not ignorant of the vſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech: Therefore, ſince he tells the Apoſtles plainly, that the Euchariſt is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy delivered for them, it muſt be his body, (as the Catholiques beleeve) and cannot be not his body, as the Preſbyterians imagine. If the Scripture be Iudge of controverſies, then this controverſie is decyded: for that Iudge, to which Proteſtants make ordinarly their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales, hath ſo determined the cauſe againſt them, that they dare not ſtand to the clear words of their Iudge; in ſo much, that ſome learned Proteſtants do confeſſe, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taken in the native, proper and literal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, is plainly for the Catholiques, againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and namely Morton, when he ſpeaks thus to the Catholiques. <hi>If the words he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true in a proper and literal ſenſe;</hi>

                  <hi>then we are to yeeld to you the whole cauſe.</hi> And therefore, they are enforced to runne to their tropes &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
               <p>But I found the holy Fathers making no ſuch gloſſes, on our Saviours clear words, &amp; taking them in their proper ſenſe. S. Auguſtin,

                  </note> may be ſeen col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Coccius and Gualterus. So that I found both the Scriptures &amp; Fathers, giving ſentence againſt the Presbyterians. The firſt for the letter, and the other for the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>This ſame truth is alſo confirmed by the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonie and authority of the vniuerſal Church, in general Councels: as the firſt Nicen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, whoſe words Bellarmin cites. The third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel of Epheſus, to which S. Cyrill of Alexandria did preſide, by which Synod the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43743:123"/> epiſtle of S. Cyrill to Neſtorius, where the real preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt is contain'd, was approved, as it was thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the fourth and fift generall Councels. to ſpeak nothing of other more late Councels.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe authorities, it was alſo made evident vnto me, by the light of reaſon, that our Saviours words, concerning the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament, cannot be but literally vnderſtood. For 1. the principall articles, or points of our faith, are not delivered in the Scriptures, but in proper and clear words. But this, by all mens Confeſſion, is a principall myſtery of our faith. Therefore it is delivered in clear and plaine tearmes. 2. That cannot be aſcrybed to Chriſt without blaſphemy, which no reaſonable or prudent man would do. But no reaſonable or prudent man would make his teſtament in obſcure and figurative words: for that were the high way to deceive his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp; heires, and put them at variance. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore ſince Chriſt, at the inſtitution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, a little before his death, was making his Teſtament, as is manifeſt by his words, when he calleth the Chalice,<note place="margin">

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43743:124"/> excellent then Manna, which was called the bread of Angels, but much inferiour to it: as is evident. 4. Chriſt, who is goodneſſe and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it ſelf, would not, for tropes and figures, have vſed ſo many aſſeverations, as are ſet down in the 6. chapter of S. Iohn. Neither would he have ſuffered ſo many of his diſciples and others to go away from him, after ſo many doubts propoſed by them: but he would have cleared the matter vnro them. Laſtly. If this liberty be once graunted to expound the Scripture figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, when we are not forced to it, by any other Scripture or article of our faith; then, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will remaine, but vncertaine opinions, of divine things; and ſo, by this means, the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le myſteries of the Chriſtian religion may be denyed, or overturned. For there is no more requiſite (according to this licentious rule) but that ſome few Noveliſts think a myſtery impoſſible, albeit all the holy Fathers &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church did ever eſteem it not only poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but alſo a truth reveal'd by God, and an article of their faith. And ſo diverſe heretiques have imagined the myſterie of the Incarnation, of the holy Trinity, and ſuch like principal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian religion to be impoſſible, and therefore have expounded all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſpeak of them, figuratively: as the Presbyterians do here. For theſe reaſons, beſides the authority of the holy Fathers, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſufficiently evident to me, that the words of Chriſt, concerning the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to be literally &amp; plainly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and not figuratively.</p>

               <p>This truth alſo of the reall preſence was shewed to me, to beteſtifyed and confirmed from heaven, by miracles: both auncient and modern; which are related by famous and faithfull Authors.

                  </note>Laſtly: for the comfort of the faithfull, or for confirmation of the doubtfull, ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have appeared in the holy Sacrament. That which is recounted in the life of S. Grego- the great, is very remarkable. The hiſtorie is briefly this. When S. Gregorie was giving the Sacrament to the people, he came to a woman, who ſmiled, when he ſaid to her, <hi>the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt preſerue thy ſoule,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Pope did withdraw his hand, &amp; lay'd the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on the altar. After the holy ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities were ended, he enquired at the woman, why she had laughed in ſo dreadfull an action. She in end confeſſed, that she could not acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge that bread, which she had made with her own hands, to be the body of Chriſt. Then S. Gregorie prayed God earneſtly for her, and obtain'd, that the bread, even in external for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, should be turned into flesh: by which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; he both reduced the woman vnto the faith, and confirmed the people in it. The faith of S. Lowis King of France,<note place="margin">Boſius li <hi>14</hi> de ſignis Eccleſ. p. <hi>145.</hi> ex Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeo an. <hi>1258.</hi>
                  </note> concerning this Sacrament, is much celebrated. For, when he, being advertiſed, that a moſt beavtifull child had appeard in the holy Sacrament, was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to come and ſee this miracle, he refuſed to goe ſaying: that theſe miracles were done for theſe, who doubted; but for himſelf, he was moſt certaine that Chriſt Ieſus was truly
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43743:126"/> preſent in the Euchariſt. An other ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition was ſeen at Doway in the yeare 1254. &amp; continueda good time,<note place="margin">Spond. ſuppl. anno <hi>1254.</hi> n. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> ſo that great numbers of people came from diverſe parts to ſee it, and the memory of it is every yeare celebrated, in that town, with great ſolemnity.</p>
               <p>By all which conſiderations, I was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſatisfyed of the Catholique belief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reall preſence, which I found to be containd in the holy Scriptures, beleeved by the holy Fathers. and by general Councels, and to be confirmed by miracles. And therefore I could not any longer believe the Preſbyterian doctrin, which, againſt all theſe authorities, makes the body of Chriſt to be as far diſtant from the Sacrament, as the heavens are from the earth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I perceived, that they ſcarcely pretend to have Scripture for them: but are enforced to runne from the clear words of it, to their tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes &amp; figures:<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de doct. Chriſt. c. <hi>10.</hi>

Neither is that much to be admired; for the ſame Father ſaith, we can hardly tell how bread and wine, or water,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43743:128"/> by eating &amp; drinking, are turned into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our body &amp; blood.

Theſe teſtimonies, beſides others, shew me ſufficiently both the poſſibility &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the thing, ſignified by tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to witt, a converſion of the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread and wine, into the ſubſtance of Chriſts body &amp; blood, the outward formes or accidents of bread &amp; wine remaining. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the Preſbyterians do affirm very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shly, in their new Confeſſion, that this change is not only repugnant to Scripture, but alſo to common ſenſe and reaſon: ſeing the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who cannot with any modeſtie be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, to have common ſenſe and reaſon, did believe and prove it, both by the Scriptures &amp; reaſon. At leaſt, I reſolved to preferre alwayes the common ſenſe of the Fathers, to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſenſe of the Preſbyterians.

Then Calvin, the third Apoſtle came in with pretence of a third light, wherewith he would illuminate the world, and reform theſe Reformers. Firſt, he taught with Zuinglius, againſt Luther, that Chriſts body is only real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the heavens, and not in the elements. Then, againſt Zuinglius, he ſaith, that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not bare ſignes, but they exhibite vnto vs the true body &amp; blood of Chriſt, which we eate by the mouth of faith.

But, as ſome grave Authours have' obſerved, Calvins opinion of the Sacrament' differs nothing in reality, from the opinion of Zuinglius; except only in obſcurity of words, which are trimmed vp to deceive men, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in hopes of realities, but indeed gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them nothing but bare figures.

                  <hi>or a figure.</hi> Thus we ſee, how theſe firſt Apoſtles of Proteſtants, like the builders of Babilon, are divi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, in ſo important an article of the Chriſtian faith. The beleef of Zinglius and Calvin in this matter, is hereſy &amp; blaſphemy to Luther &amp; his Schollers. And Luthers faith, to Calvin, is a meer raverie, more inſuportable, then the Popish tranſubſtantiation. If this diſſenſſion
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43743:131"/> was ſo great, at the beginning; how great muſt it be now, in the progreſſe? How can theſe men be true Apoſtles, who diſagreed ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly &amp; bitterly, in ſuch a neceſſarie &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal point of the Chriſtian religion? Or what aſſurance can any man have, who followeth ſuch vnſure Guides?</p>
               <p>To conclude this point: I could hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire greater ſatifaction for the Catholique be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the real preſence, then by Gods grace I found: to witt, expreſſe Scriptures, the holy Fathers, vniuerſal Church, famous miracles, &amp; the light of reaſon, grounded vpon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wiſdome of Chriſt: whereas for the Preſbyterian opinion, which is an ancient he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, &amp; is condemned by the Lutherans as a blaſphemie, I found we had no Scriptures, but were enforced to flie, from the clear words of it, to tropes &amp; figures, &amp; to ſome shallow car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſons, againſt the Scripture &amp; omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of God: which reaſons I saw clearly anſwered in the Catholique writers: and, as a Catholique shew me, more ſtrong reaſons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been brought by Pagans &amp; ſome heretiques, againſt the myſterie of the Trinitie &amp; Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I perceived alſo, that the Preſbyterians involved their opinion in ſuch obſcurities, that, by their words, one might collect they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both a real preſence &amp; a real abſence, and they made vſe of either, as the time required; and that the moſt part of them did not know, and could not tell what they beleeved. But at length, when the beſt of them were well ſifted;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43743:131"/> all ended in this, that Chriſts body was only in the heavens; neither was it poſſible to be in the Sacrament, nor in two places, at once. And ſo their pretended real preſence proved indeed to be a real abſence. In a word, I found that the Preſbyterians, by taking away the real body of Chriſt from this Sacrament, and giving vs an emptie figure, do really take away the ſubſtance of this Sacrament, and ſo deſtroy it: as they had done before to baptiſm, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying both the vertue and neceſſitie of it. And therefore in effect, they have deſtroied both theſe Sacraments, which they would ſeem to have left. Their doctrin, which denyes the Sacraments to conferre grace, shewes, that they eſteem them gracleſſe, and their ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom vſeing of them, eſpecially of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, manifeſts, that they think them vſeleſſe or fruiltleſſe.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Some Reflections, vpon both the pretended Scottish Reformations.</head>
               <p>HAVING found aboundant ſatisfaction for the truth of the Catholique doctrin, in the points lately tryed, I did freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the Catholique, by whoſe advice and aſſiſtance, I had made this laſt Trial of our firſt Reformation; that I did not only ſee the truth to be vpon the Catholiques ſide; but alſo that I perceived a notable difference, between the ſublimity of the Catholique doctrin, and the lowneſſe of Preſbyterian opinions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning rhe holy Sacraments, and particularly the Euchariſt. Wherevpon, he took occaſion to shew me, that there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch a notable difference, between the doctrines of the true Church, &amp; all heretical opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s;s that as ſome of the ancient Fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare iuſtly heretiques, to the prodigal child, who left his Fathers houſe; ſo they fitly parallel their doctrines, to the husks where with he was fed. For thus ſpeaketh S. Gregory Nyſſen. <hi>A fugitive from the faith, went into a far Countrey, and divided his Fathers goods into two halfes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nyſſ orat. in ſuam ordinat</note> 
                  <hi>whilſt he threw down ſublime doctrines, to baſe &amp; Swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish opinions, and waſted his riches with whoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish hereſies. For hereſy is a harlot, which with pleaſures, as with deceits, draweth many vnto her.</hi> So one, who leaves the Catholique
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43743:132"/> Church, that rich houſe of his heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leaves alſo the heavenly bread of Chriſts precious body, wherewith his children are nourished and feaſted, and going aſtray vnto Calvins Congregation, finds nothing but an empty drie Calviniſtical ſupper, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing divine, no iuice in it, but bare ſignes &amp; figures; which contayn leſſe then Manna, or the shew bread of the ancient table. He leaves alſo the other ſublime doctrines, concerning the Sacraments, as how they conferre ſanctifying, grace, purge the ſoule from ſin &amp;c. and is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vaine opinions, in which nothing is ſolid, nothing ſtable that can ſatisfie the minde. Therefore he ſtriveth to ſatiat himſelf dayly, with new opinions and idle inventions: but all in vaine: for theſe are nothing but husks, which leave the bellie empty. There is no remedie for him, but to return with the prodigal child vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fathers houſe, where he will be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with ioy, and feaſted with the bread of Angels.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid the Catholique, to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reflection, vpon all that hath paſt vnder this Trial: Do you not now clearly ſee, how fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly theſe Reformers pretend alwayes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be for them, when you have found the Scriptures ſo expreſly againſt them, in all theſe principal points of the Chriſtian religion, already examined? And which is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; have you not ſeen theſe Scriptures to be ſo vnderſtood by the holy Fathers, in the pure and primitive times; as they are now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43743:133"/> by the Roman Catholiques? Do y not now perceive, how Hereſy, like a ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pet, fardeth her ſelf with the colours of the divin Scriptures; by which fain'd and falſe beauty, she allures and deceives many: but ſo ſoone as she is brought near the fire of Triall, how her fardings melt &amp; fall away, and her own vglineſſe appeares? Among heretiques, ſaith S. Auguſtin,<note place="margin">Aug. cont. epist. fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d c. <hi>1.</hi> Ioſeph. lib. <hi>5</hi> de bello Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>daico c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> there is nothing but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of truth, a meer shew or pretext of it, no performance. Their doctrines are like the fruites of Sodom and Gomorrha, which, as Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus teſtifyeth, have a ſpecious shew, and appear pleaſant vnto the eye; but ſo ſoone as they are touched, fall into ashes. So truly are all hereticall opinions; they are given out for the fruites of pure Scriptures, they appeare very ſpecious and pleaſant: but ſo ſoone as they are tryed diligently according to the Scriptures, and are touched, as it were, by the fingers of the holy Fathers, they preſently evanish; and nothing remaines but the flammes of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſſentions, like the ſmoak of Sodom &amp; Gomorrha, as a teſtimonie of the divin iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vpon them. Have you not now ſeen, that theſe two pretended Scottish Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have between them compleated the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious work of deſolation, and deſtroyed the 4 principal pillars of the Chriſtian religion: and that, as the later hath taken away two, to witt: the Lords prayer and the Apoſtles Creed: ſo the firſt hath taken away in effect the other two, to witt: the divin Commandments, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43743:133"/> the holy Sacraments: and ſo the Presbyterians haye overturned what their Predeceſſors left vntouched? In a word, they may be briefly deſcribed thus.</p>
               <p>They have a <hi>Creed</hi> from the Apoſtles, which they do not beleeve: they have a <hi>prayer</hi> from Chriſt, which they do not ſay: they have <hi>Commandments</hi> from God which they profeſſe they will not keep: and the <hi>two Sacraments</hi> of the law of grace, which they had only left to themſelves, they have made altogether gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeſſe, &amp; almoſt vſeleſſe. And beſids all this, they have robbed the holy <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> and the Church of the Apoſtolique governement, together with all order &amp; decency: to ſpeak nothing of their other ſmaller pranks. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I am now confident, that you have found what I promiſed, at the beginning, to witt: that the firſt pretended Reformation was no better grounded, then the laſt; and that the end of both hath been total deſolation, and the deſtruction of the chief Pillars af the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion: whereas, vpon the contrary, you have ſeen the Catholique religion (which you had heard ſo often calumniated with ſtrong and shameleſſe cries) to be, in all theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal points: conforme to the Scriptures and holy Fathers, and to the primitive Church. Thus he.</p>
               <p>As I was ſo clearly convinced in all theſe particulars, that I behoved to renounce both knowledge, &amp; conſcience, if I would deny them; ſo I did ingenuoſly confeſſe to him my
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43743:134"/> ſatisfaction: and withall, I promised, if I could find the like evidence for the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, in all the other controuerſies, that I would, by Gods grace, render my ſelf a Roman Catholique. To which he anſwered, that the triall of all the particular doctrines in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, after the former manner, was a long, laborious, md needleſſe way, and that God had appoint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, he would vndertake to prove shortly, by a clear vndeniable Principle, and granted by all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, the Proteſtant Religion &amp; their whole Church to be falſe: and by the ſame principle, to shew clearly, the preſent Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, to be the ancient Catholique Church eſtablished by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles; and to have continued ſtill in their doctrin, without any variation. And ſo with ſome confidence, ariſing from my former experience, I prepared my ſelf to receive this new inſtruction.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> That the true Church of Chriſt muſt be perpetuall, and muſt endure without interruption, vnto the end of the world.</head>
               <p>THE principle, ſaid my Catholique friend, whereby I will demonſtrate the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church not to be the true Church of Chriſt, shall be ſo evident and convincent; that, as nothing is more expreſly in Scriptures, ſo nothing is more freely granted by Luther &amp; Calvin, &amp; generally by all learned Proteſtants. And this principle is the perpetuity of Chriſts Church, or that Chriſt muſt have a Church, which hath endured from his aſcenſion, vntill this time: &amp; shall endure from this, vntill the end of the world. Before I proceed further, I will firſt manifeſt vnto you the ſtrength of this truth by the Scriptures, Fathers, by Proteſtants, and their reaſons. The paſſages of Scripture for this truth, are many, but I shall content my ſelfe with ſome few, which may ſerve for your ſatisfaction. The firſt do concern the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal kingdome of Chriſt, by which, all men vnderſtand his Church. Of this the prophet Daniel ſaith. <hi>In the dayes of theſe Kings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Daniel.</hi> 2.44.</note> 
                  <hi>the God of heaven shall ſet vp a kingdome, which shall never be deſtroyed, &amp;c. It shall break in pieces all theſe kingdomes, and it shall ſtand for ever.</hi> The
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43743:135"/> Angel Gabriel, ſpeaking of the ſame kingdom of Chriſt, to the bleſſed Virgin, ſaid: <hi>And of his kingdome there shall be no end.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33.</note> Calvin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by theſe places and others, which ſpeak of the kingdome of Chriſt, the perpetuity of of his Church againſt Servetus. So doth alſo Beza and the Confeſſion of Holland. If then the kingdome of Chriſt be perpetual, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re muſt alwaies be ſome to acknowledge him to be their King. The ſecond paſſages of Scripture contayne Chriſts promiſes to his Church,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am with you alway, even vnto the conſummation of the world.</hi> Which place both S. Auguſtin and S. Hierome do bring to prove the ſame truth. The firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Church ſpeaking thus to Chriſt. <hi>Shew vnto me the fewneſſe of my dayes,</hi>

                  <hi>how long shall I be in this world. Shew this vnto me, for thoſe who ſay, she was, but now is not: the Church hath made Apoſtaſy and perished from all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And he declared vnto me. Behold I am
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43743:135"/> with you alway even vnto conſummation of the world.</hi> S. Hierome ſaith, that Chriſt,<note place="margin">Hier. in cap. vlt. Matth.</note> by theſe words, shews there should be alwayes ſome faithfull people in this world, &amp; that he should never ſeparate himſelf from them. I paſſe by many more places of Scripture, which is ſo evident for the perpetuity of Chriſts Church, that S. Auguſtin ſaid againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts, who denyed it,<note place="margin">Avg. pref. in <hi>2.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ. pſa. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> and affirmed the Church had perished: <hi>They mock Chriſt in a matter, which is evident, in a matter, where no man can ſay, I did not underſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth is not only evident in Scriptures and Fathers, but it is alſo acknowledged by all Proteſtants, whoſe minds are beſt knowne by their Confeſſions of faith, which ought to be of more authority amongſt them, then the teſtimonies of their private writers.<note place="margin">Conf.

                  </note> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Auſburg, of Saxonie, &amp; of the Suizers do not only affirm, that the Church muſt ſtill continue vnto the end of the world: but they prove it, by the expreſſe Scriptures above cited. The Authors of our firſt Scottish Confeſſion profeſſe, that they beleeve as fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely the perpetuity of the Church, as they beleeve the myſterie of the Trinity:<note place="margin">

                  </note> for thus they ſpeak. <hi>As we beleeve in God the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt; ſo we do moſt earneſtly beleeve that from the beginning, there hath been, now is, and to the end of the world shall be a Church.</hi> The new Confeſſion at Weſtminſter profeſſeth the ſame truth. And ſo do alſo Luther, &amp; Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin; as we shall ſee preſently.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:43743:136"/>
               <p>Now the contrarie doctrin, to witt, that the Church of Chriſt did perish, or can perish, is cenſured, both by Catholiques &amp; Proteſtants as a moſt damnable errour, iniurious to God, &amp; againſt the clear Scriptures. S. Aug. teſtimonie shall ſuffice for the Firſt. For againſt the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who defended the like error, and ſaid, <hi>But that Church, which was of all Nations, is no more,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. in pſ. <hi>101.</hi>

Neither is the iudgment of Caluin againſt that error, leſſe ſevere. For writing againſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus, who defended it, and who was burnt by his order, at Geneva; he ſaith: <hi>I did not touch that long banishment of the Church from the earth,</hi>

                  <hi>which he faineth; wherein he plainly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God of a lie.</hi> And afterward he maketh this profeſſion. <hi>But we indeed confeſſe that the Church was put in glorious places: otherwiſe God would have lied, who promiſed that he should alwayes have ſome people, ſo long as the Sun and Moone shall shine in the firmament. We know what the prophets do every where teftifie of the eternall kingdome of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of theſe great cenſures is very evident. For 1. there is nothing ſo often and ſo
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43743:136"/> clearly promiſed in the Scriptures, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie of the Church of Chriſt. If then, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe clear promiſes, the Church might perish; then all the other myſteries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd in Scripture might be denyed; then it would follow, that God were a liar, as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin reaſoneth againſt Servetus. 2. If the Church could perish, then that article of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed, <hi>I believe the holy Catholique Church,</hi> would be falſe, and therefore none could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve truely that to be, which had no being. This reaſon is brought by Luther. 3. It would follow that men could not be ſaved:<note place="margin">Luth. tom. <hi>7.</hi> de votis verae Eccleſiae f. <hi>148.</hi> Conf. Vveſt, cap. <hi>25.</hi> n. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> for out of the true Church there is no ordinarie poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Salvation; as our new Confeſſion of faith acknowledgeth. Now what could be more againſt the goodneſſe &amp; mercy of God? what more iniurious to the merits of Chriſts paſſion, then to take away the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which would be clearly taken away, if the Church did perish? By all which, may be ſeen, that the perpetuity of Chriſts Church is not only clearly contayn'd in the Scriptures, &amp; holy Fathers; but alſo, that it's granted by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants &amp; proved by their reaſons: and that the contrarie opinion, to witt, that the Church can perish, is cenſured both by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques &amp; Proteſtants, as a moſt pernicious &amp; damnable Error. Thus ſpake the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</p>
               <p>I was ſo ſatisfied of the truth of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that I deſired no more for the evidence of it: and I profeſſed, if, by it, the Proteſtant

               <p>But, to perform this the better, the ſame Catholique shew me, that it was neceſſarie to lay down an other principle, to witt, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition or deſcription of a Proteſtant Church. And although, ſaid he, this be difficult, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Proteſtants are very inconſtant and changeable in their doctrin, which is the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Church; ſo that, the definition which will ſerve them this yeare, may perhaps not fit them the next; for which cauſe ſome have affirmed, that it's as hard to find out a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will alwayes agree to them, as to paint Proteus, or make a fit coate for the Moone; yet, notwithſtanding theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; a general notion may be had of them, and the beſt appear's to be that, which is taken from their Confeſſions of faith. So that the Proteſtant Church of Scotland may be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to be a Society of people, beleeving the whole articles of the Scottish Confeſſion. And other Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Churches, as of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, France,</hi> &amp;c. may be deſcribed after the ſame manner by their ſeveral Confeſſions. For theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions diſtinguish them, from all other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and they require no more of any, to be eſteem'd a Proteſtant of their reſpective Churches, then to ſubſcrive and ſwear their Confeſſions. But it is to be obſerved, that theſe Confeſſions muſt be beleeved wholly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43743:137"/> and not only a part of them: otherwiſe all heretiques might be eſteem'd Proteſtants. For Arius, Sabellius and the reſt beleeved ſome of theſe articles; and yet were not Proteſtants. Theſe two grounds being ſetled, he proceeded to his proof.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> That the Protestant Church hath not been perpetual; yea was not at all before Luther, and therefore is not the true Church.</head>
               <p>FROM the former two principles which I granted, and conceive no Proteſtant can deny, this argument was made vnto me. The true Church of Chriſt hath ſtill continued wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout interruption, ſince the aſcenſion of Chriſt. But the Proteſtant Church hath only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſince the apoſtaſy of Luther. Therefore the Proteſtant Church is not the true Church of Chriſt. The maior is evident by the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the perpetuity of the Church The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is proved, by the ſecond principle, after this manner. The Proteſtant Church, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Scotland, is a Church beleeving all the articles of the Scottish Confeſſion (and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me may be proportionally ſaid of all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, and their Confeſſions). But before Luther, there was no Church, which beleeved that Confeſſion, or any other of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43743:138"/> Proteſtant Confeſſions. Therefore there was no Proteſtant Church before Luther: and conſequently it hath only continued ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the fall of Luther. The Maior is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the ſecond principle. The Minor, to witt, that there was no Church before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which beleeved any Proteſtant Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is proved thus. If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re had been any Church before Luther, beleeving any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Confeſſion, it was either viſible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible: there is no medium. But there was no Church either viſible or inviſible, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved any Proteſtant Confeſſion. Therefore there was no Church at all beleeving any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Confeſſion, before Luther. If you will affirm, ſaid he, that there was ſuch a Church viſible: I ask where it was to be ſeen before Luther appeared? Which can never be sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen If you ſay there was a Church, beleeving ſome Proteſtant Confeſſion, but inviſible: I demand only for the preſent, how the true Church can be inviſible? How can the true Church be without doctrin &amp; Sacraments: neither of which can be had in an inviſible Church? But I shall prove he after, that the Scriptures, Fathers, &amp; right reaſon are as evident for the viſibility, as they are for the perpetuity of the Church. Yea, I shall shew, that, albeit the true Church could be inviſible, the Proteſtant Church was not ſo much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, before Luther: and therefore was not at all. Viſibility &amp; inviſibility are indeed the two
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43743:138"/> ſtarting holes, by which your Authors think to eſcape, when they are preſt by this argument: and therefore they muſt be both diligently watcht. For there is a cuſtom, as S. Auguſtin obſerves, common to foxes &amp; heretiques.<note place="margin">Aug. in pſa. <hi>80.</hi> Cant. <hi>2</hi>
                  </note> As foxes have two entries to their hole, to the end they may ſave themſelves by the one, when they are purſued by the other; ſo heretiques, whom the Scripture reſſembles to foxes, have a double iſſue in their anſwers; that they may eſcape by the one, when they find themſelves aſſaulted &amp; pres't by the other. This cuſtome many Proteſtants obſerve well in this ſame matter. For, when they are pres't to shew their Church before Luther, they ſay often it was inviſible, &amp; therefore could neither be known nor shown. But when it is proved by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures &amp; right reaſon, that the true Church muſt be viſible; then they make many shifts to shew it was viſible; and when all theſe faile, they run back again vnto their hole of inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and ſo think to eſcape that way. Thus he.</p>
               <p>But I eſteeming viſibility a more honorable &amp; natural propertie of the Church of Chriſt, then inviſibility, ſince Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> which were impoſſible to be done, if the Church were not viſible; &amp; knowing that diverſe famous Proteſtants do affirm, that their Church was viſible before Luther: I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, if he would gain his point, to shew me firſt that the Proteſtant Church was not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible before Luther. Wherevpon he toul dme that he would prove that very particularly: but
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43743:139"/> firſt, he would shew me in general, that even theſe Proteſtants, who pretend their Church to have been viſible, cannot endure to be ask'd that fatal queſtion; <hi>where was your Church before Luther?</hi> For, knowing the hardneſſe of this queſtion, and the inſufficiency of their anſwers, they endeavour to shift it, calling it an vniuſt, impertinent demand, an old, but vnneceſſarie queſtion, a queſtion of hiſtorie, which would require twentie yeares ſtudy. But, ſaid he, if this demand be vniuſt,<note place="margin">Tertul. de preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crip. c. <hi>31.</hi> Optat. l. <hi>1.</hi> ad Parmen p. <hi>48.</hi> Aug. in collat. <hi>3.</hi> diei cap. <hi>6.</hi> Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del praef in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocoll.

                  </note> then the Fathers were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, who made the ſame demand to the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques of their time, &amp; required them to shew the origine of their Churches, and to tell what they were, and whence they came. Yea, if this demand be vniuſt, ſome chief Proteſtants are vniuſt, who made the ſame to diverſe ſectaries, who have gone out from them. For the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logs of Heydelberg ſpeak thus to the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts: <hi>If you be the Church of God, it followeth that God hath been without people, and without a Church, &amp;c.</hi> And the reaſon, which they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyn, is very remarkable: for it is directly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſecond principle above ſetled. <hi>For if you</hi> (ſay they) <hi>would read over all hiſtories, you shall find no people. from the beginning of the world, that hath made a Confeſſion of faith like yours</hi> Beza hath alſo been vniuſt, who preſſeth the new Arians with the like queſtion: <hi>If their doctrin,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be true, we require them to show vs at length, in what place their Church hath been.</hi> Theſe teſtimonies, to paſſe by many others, do shew, that this queſtion is neither
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43743:139"/> vniuſt, nor impertinent; and that theſe Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who vrge it ſo hardly againſt others, do know the great ſtrength and evidence of it: which they cunningly diſſemble, or maliciouſly deny, when it's vrged againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>But, that this queſtion is not vniuſt, may be shewed alſo by reaſon. For, if the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church hath been viſible, it muſt have been in ſome place viſible. Since then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, nor heare of it, before Luther aroſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all hiſtories have been ſearched, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords pervſed, which do inform vs, of things leſſe conſiderable; as ſometimes of one ſingle man, when, and where he aroſe, and oppoſed the Church, and yet not ſo much as one word can be found of a whole, viſible, continual ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Proteſtants: and beſids, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found in hiſtories, they have left no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents behind them, by which they may be known to have been in the world, before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: although they have left many ruinous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents behind them, ſince Luther: ſeing, I ſay, after all this diligence, we cannot find out this viſible Proteſtant Church, and yet theſe Proteſtants affirm that it was viſible, we moſt iuſtly require them to help &amp; tell vs, where their Church was, in what kingdome, province, or citie; and, if they cannot do this, we may iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly conclude, that their allegation is a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe imagination, invented to deceive men, againſt their ſenſe &amp; vnderſtanding, in a matter of greateſt importance. But wc do not as yet make any ſuch concluſion: we only require
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43743:140"/> them to shew, what we cannot ſee by our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, to point vnto vs, where their Church was, that we may fix our ey's towards that place; and for ſatisfaction, we are anſwered, that the demand is vniuſt, and we impertinent, if we do not beleeve, vpon their bare word, that their Church was viſible; albeit neither we can find, nor they can tell, where it was. But all prudent and indifferent men would think it much more iniuſtice &amp; impertinencie, both in them to require, and in vs to beleeve, that their Church was viſible, before it can be shewed where it was; then in vs to require where it was, before we beleeve, that it was. <hi>Who giveth credit quickly</hi>

               <p>Moreover this is not only a iuſt and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but alſo a moſt neceſſarie and important queſtion. For thereby, all falſe Churches are clearly &amp; ſenſibly diſcovered, even to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt capacities. Becauſe, if the Church of Chriſt muſt be perpetual, as hath been eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly demonſtrated, and if it muſt be alſo perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually viſible, as theſe Proteſtants, of whom we now ſpeak, do grant: then it followeth, when ever a new Church or Congregation ariſeth, with a new Confeſſion of faith, which was not ſee nor known before, that that Church is not the true Church of Chriſt, which ought to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43743:140"/> be alwayes both perpetual &amp; viſibie. For this cauſe, the holy Fathers did vrge this queſtion ſo hardly, by which they confounded all heretical &amp; new vpſtart Churches.</p>
               <p>And, whereas ſome Proteſtants do alleadge,<note place="margin">du Mou lin in his Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueauté cont. Card. Peron. c. <hi>12.</hi>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43743:141"/> back again to the Papiſts, ſaying that their Church before Luther, was in the very heart of Popery. 6. Finding that their new coin'd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of fundamental points, involves them in great labyrinths, and that the Papiſts will not acknowledge them, for their Aſſociats: they paſſe from the later, vnto the purer times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S.

Theſe many different anſwers shew, that the Proteſtant Church hath no great certainty of its pedegree, I shall briefly shew you the inſufficiency of every one of theſe anſwers, by which it shall be proved, that the Proteſtant Church was not viſible before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and hereby their firſt ſtarting hole shall be either ſo ſtop't, or lay'd, that they cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape this way.</p>

               <p>THAT the Proteſtant Church may be continued in the Waldenſes (and the ſame is to be obſerved of the Albigenſes and the reſt) two things are to be proved by Proteſtants. 1. That the Waldenſes have ever continued ſince the time of the Apoſtles. And this is clear by the firſt vndeniable principle of the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church. 2. That the Waldenſes were intirely of that faith, which the Proteſtants do now, or did profeſſe; that is beleeved any of their Confeſſions of faith. For, without this whole agreement, the Waldenſes could not be a Proteſtant Church, as is evident, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond principle above ſetled. Now it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them, to shew either of theſe two.</p>
               <p>For firſt, concerning the continuance of the Waldenſes, all hiſtories do affirm, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the twelfth age, and that their Author was one <hi>Waldo</hi> a marchant of Lions; about the yeare 1160. whom the Centuriſts place in the 12. Century. How can it be then proved,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cent.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> that the Waldenſes had continued ſince the Apoſtles ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; ſeing their Author, who was before a Catholique, &amp; a Laique, lived neer 12. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after the Apoſtles; ſuppoſeing then,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43743:142"/> that Waldo became a Proteſtant, after he had been before a Catholique; the queſtion remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, where was the Proteſtant Church befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Waldo? The true Church muſt be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Waldenſes did not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſince the Apoſtles, ſo neither did they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree intirly with Proteſtants,<note place="margin">Luth. in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loq. c de Sacr. Calvin epiſt. <hi>224.</hi>

And if we will truſt Calvin, they held alſo the reall preſence, in the Popish ſenſe, of Tranſubſtantiation. Therefore, ſuch men could not be Proteſtants.</p>

                  </note>Thirdly, they agreed with the Catholiques in diverſe other points, as about the number &amp; nature of the Sacraments, the vow of chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, the neceſſity of childrens baptiſm. They began a kind of religious order, for which they were called, the poore men of Lions, and ſought confirmation of it from Pope Innocent the third, but could not obtayn it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly they maintaind diverſe groſſe errours, which are condemned, both by Catholiques &amp; Proteſtants.<note place="margin">Ibidem ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſ. <hi>4.</hi>

That Churchmen should poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe nothing in propertie. 4. That it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to diſſemble in religion; and their practice was conform to their doctrin: for they went to Maſſe, confeſſed and communicated. For which diſſimulation, the Proteſtants, at the

Therefore, the Proteſtants cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their viſible Church, by the Grecians, who were, for many ages, Catholiques, who never were, nor yet are Proteſtants, and are known to this day, for a great part, to be Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiques.</p>

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:43743:147"/> shew their Church to be viſible, before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which we shall shortly run over.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> That the Proteſtant Church was not viſible in the primitive Church, or the holy Fathers; nor thereafter, in the Roman Church.</head>
               <p>IT was very ordinary for the old Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, of the late English Church, to allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, that the ancient Fathers were of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that their Church was conforme to the primitive Church. In which matter M. Iewels appeale to the Fathers of the firſt 6. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, is very famous. But that pretence is idle, in regard of our preſent queſtion. 2. it is falſe. Firſt it's idle: becauſe, were it true (as we shall ſee it to be, moſt falſe) that theſe Fathers of the firſt 5. or 6. hundred years, were Proteſtants; yet, could not that ſuffice to prove them a continued ſucceſſion of 1600. years. For I enquire what became of the Proteſtant Church after the Fathers, to the time of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Did it perish, or not? If it perished: then it is not the true Church, which muſt be perpetual, according to the firſt vndeniable principle above ſetled. If the Proteſtant Church did not perish, but remain'd viſible for 900. years, between the Fathers &amp; Luther:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:43743:147"/> then the queſtion remaines, where was it, in what kingdome, Province, or Citie? which-can never be shewed. Yea, ſome famous Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants do acknowledge,<note place="margin">Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>kins expoſ. ſymbol. p. <hi>266.</hi> whit,</note> that all that time the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſtant Church was not to be ſeen. Therefore, although the Fathers were granted to have been Proteſtants, the Proteſtant Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be continued, by them, after their time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, its moſt falſe that the Fathers were Proteſtants. 1. Becauſe the Chriſtians of the ſixth age muſt needs know better, what was the religion and tenets of them, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the fifth age, by whom they were inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructed, and with whom they converſed, th n Proteſtants can do now. But theſe Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have proteſted on their ſalvation, that it was the very ſame with theirs, receiv'd from them, by word of mouth. Therefore, if the Chriſtians of the ſixth age were not Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, neither were the Fathers and Chriſtians of the 5. age Proteſtants, and ſo you may go vpward, even to the Apoſtles. This reaſon shall be more cleared hereafter. 2. It may be known, that the Fathers were not Proteſtants by the points already examined. For they did not beleeve Iuſtification by faith only, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of keeping the Commandments: They did not deny the neceſſity &amp; effect of baptiſm, they did not deny the real preſence: which are principal articles of the Proteſtant religion: but taught the quite contrary; as hath been ſeen. Therefore, according to the ſecond principle above ſetled, they were not Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43743:148"/> 3. Not to deſcend to particular doctrines, this ſame truth may be shewed, by the little account Proteſtants make of the Fathers, whom they would highly eſteem, if they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for them; and in a word, by the open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the chief Proteſtants, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were againſt them, in many things. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if he were a little after cups, ſpeaks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intemperatly of the Fathers. <hi>In the writing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of Hierome there is not a word of true faith,</hi>

And therefore the Preſbyterians, who diſclaime the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; yeeld them to the Papiſts, are much more ſincere &amp; ingenuous in this matter, then the late English Proteſtants: who laid claime to the Fathers, &amp; deceitfully made the people beleeve, that they were Proteſtants; which they were enforced to deny, when they were dealing with Schollers, as may appeare by the former teſtimonies. By all which, it is more then evident; that the holy Fathers and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church were not Proteſtants; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, the Proteſtant Church cannot be she<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed to be viſible in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: much leſſe can the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of it be continued after them.

               <p>The laſt valiant attempt was made by ſome famous Proteſtants, who, after they had ſeen that all their neighbours and Predeceſſors had wearied themſelves in vaine, by travailing all the world over, to find out a viſible Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church, before Luther, which could not be found; had in end their recourſe vnto the Popish Church, as vnto a City of refuge, in this great ſtraight. They taught two things. 1. That the Roman &amp; Proteſtant Churches are
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:43743:149"/> all one Church, as agreing in all fundamental points of faith, although they diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gree in not fundamentals; and by this diſtinction, they think to anſwer eaſily that hard queſtion, where was your Church before Luther? To witt: they ſay, it was the ve y ſame with the Roman, which they acknowledge to be a true Church, keeping all the fundamental points of religion, which are neceſſary to ſalvation; albeit she had ſome errors not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal, which do not deſtroy the nature of the Church, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make it ſi k and weak. And ſo by this means they think to avoid all the inconveniences, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which other Proteſtants do fall. For hereby; it is shewed, that the Church did not perish, nor was inviſible, nor was only viſible for a time, but was perpetually viſible. 2. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the Proteſtant Church made any real ſubſtantial ſepara ion from the Roman: and affirm, that all, which they did, was only to free themſelves of ſome errors, which as ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes (though not in themſelves mortal) had crep't in, vpon the Roman Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rch, which being often advertiſed of her maladies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to cure them, would admit no medicine: which the Proteſtants, taking at length, in a cup of Reformation, did purge themſelves of all infirmities, and thereby their Church was rendred whole and ſound. So that there is no more difference between the Roman &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church, then between the ſame man, whole &amp; ſick, who by health and ſickneſſe is not ſubſtantially different, but remaines ſtill
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:43743:149"/> the ſame man. The Proteſtants, who followed this courſe, were famous in their own genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and much cryed vp for learning &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as Hooker, the Bishop of Spalato, Feild, Bunny, Potter, Chilingworth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe others, as may be ſeen, in the B. of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons treatiſe of fundamental points, and in the Proteſtants Apologie. I shall content my ſelf with the teſtimony of M. Bunny, who writes thus:<note place="margin">Bunny Tract. de Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. ſect. <hi>18.</hi> p. <hi>108.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>No queſtion ought to be made for our ſeparation from the Church. For we make not a diſtinct Church from them, nor they from vs. There was therefore no ſeparation made fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church; neither did any of vs go out from them. The only queſtion may be, which of vs are to be eſteemed the more wholſome members of the Church, we, or they? Neither is there any other queſtion approved by vs.</hi> Yea, he acknowledgeth, that, vnleſſe this anſwer be made; the Papiſts have great advantage, in their old queſtion; ſeing the Proteſtants cannot shew a Church diſtinct, from the Roman, before Luther.</p>
               <p>But this anſwer of theſe late Authors is as falſe and inſufficient, as any of the former. Firſt it directly contradicts the d ctrine &amp; practice of their Reformers, who are ſuppoſed to have been heavenly Apoſtles. For they accuſed the Roman Church of Idolatrie, ſuperſtition, and diverſe groſſe fundamental errors, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke not a Church to be only ſick, but alſo kill and deſtroy it, and as the Preſbyterians ſpeak, make it of the Church of Chriſt, become the Synagogue of Sathan &amp; Anti-Chriſt. Then for ſeparation: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> firſt Reformers were ſo far
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43743:150"/> from denying it, that they invited all perſons to ſeparate themſelves from the Roman Church, which they called ſpiritu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l <hi>Babylon,</hi> And according to this doctrin, their practice followed. Therefore it is evident, that the firſt Reformers did not think the Roman and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church all one, in fundamentals, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they deny ſeparation from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, but rather the quite contrarie is moſt clear and certaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Diverſe other famous Proteſtants condemne this new opinion, as im ious. For M. Perkins writes thus.<note place="margin">Perk. in c. <hi>8.</hi> ad Galat. v. <hi>9.</hi> Whita. cont. <hi>2.</hi> quaeſt. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>

                  <hi>The Politician, who is of no religion, ſaith, hat we and the Papiſts differ not in ſubſtance.</hi> And Whiteker ſaith plainly, <hi>that the Roman Church hath taken away many fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental articles of faith, and corrupted faith in the principal parts.</hi> All the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her late Proteſtants, and eſpecially the Preſbyterians condemne the same opinion. For nothing almoſt can incenſe them m re, then to ſay, that the Church of Rome is a true Church, and that the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants made no ſeparation from her. Hence it came to paſſe, that M. Hooker was sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, for this device, by the Puritans, in their Chriſtian letters.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, beſids all theſe confuſions &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions among themſelves, the anſwer in it ſelf is falſe &amp; inſufficient. For, when we are ſeeking a Proteſtant viſible Church before Luther, theſe men shew vs the Popish Church: and albeit all the world knowes, that Papiſts are not Proteſtants; yet they affirm, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:43743:150"/> the Popish and Proteſtant Church are all one, &amp; differ not ſubſtantially: which is a double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o shew one thing very different for another; and then to affirm, that they are both one. But I conceive, it can hardly enter into a mans imagination, vnleſſe it be troubled, to think, that theſe Churches are ſubſtantially one, which differ and are clearly oppoſite, in the principal, ſubſtantial points of religion, as in <hi>Sacrifice, Sacraments,</hi> the obſervation of the <hi>divine Commandments, iuſtifying faith, good works</hi> and many others particulars. The one Church approveth External Sacrifice, as a moſt acceptable ſervice and worship due to God, and offers vp the Chriſtian ſacrifice, as the moſt excellent of all ſacrifices and adores it as God. The other hath no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at all, but condemnes that, as great abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation &amp; groſſe Idolatrie, which the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the greateſt obiect and exerciſe of its piety. This difference alone, albeit we ſpeak of no more, is ſo great; that M. <hi>Dallie,</hi> a renown'd Min ſter in France doth affirm, in his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie which he wrote lately for the reformed Churches, and is approved by his Colleagues the Miniſters of <hi>Charenton,</hi> that it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to iuſtifie the Proteſtants ſeparation from the Roman Church, and to hinder their vnion again with it, as being a moſt ſubſtantial and fundamental difference. By which, it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the ground, whereon this anſwer is founded, to witt, that there are no fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal differences, between the Catholique &amp;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43743:151"/> Proteſtant Church, is falſe; both in it felt, &amp; in the iudgment of the firſt Reformers, &amp; of many other famous Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>But, whither there be fundamental diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, or not; the anſwer is not ſufficient: For the q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſtion ſtill remaines, where was the Proteſtant Church before Luther? that is a Church believing all the articles of a Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Confeſſion, whither ſome of them b cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fundamental, or not fundamental; or (if they pleaſe) of men holding all theſe articles, and eſteeming ſome of them fundamental and ſome not. For we are now ſeeking a Proteſtant Church, before Luther, and according to the definition above ſetled, ſuch a Church is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, beleeving all the articles of their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore, they muſt shew vs ſuch a Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or elſe they do not shew vs a Proteſtant Church. Yea, the points, which they call not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal, wherein they diſagree fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Papiſts, are theſe, which make them properly Proteſtants. If then they confeſſe (as they muſt do) that no ſociety can be had before Luther, which believed all theſe points, which they call not fundamental; they muſt alſo grant, that there was no viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church before Luther: which is directly to ſuccumb &amp; faile in that, which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to shew. So that, albeit this diſtinction of fundamentals, &amp;c. were admitted, as good &amp; true, whereas indeed, in their ſenſe, it's falſe and deceitfull, as we shall ſee more clearly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter; yet, in relation to the preſent queſtion, it would ſerve them to no purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:43743:151"/>
               <p>Theſe reaſons are, more then ſufficient, to shew, that this new anſwer is falſe and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and is nothing but a meer shift, deviſed to elude the queſtion: And that it cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorie to any man, who is ſearching for the truth; which is condemned by famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This sheweth clearly the great ſtraight &amp; neceſſity: wherevnto ſuch learned and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men were reduced, in anſwering this hard queſtion, which required an accompt of the Proteſtant Church before Luther. For they could not ſay, the Church had perished, which had been a blaſphemous falshood againſt the moſt clear Scriptures: they ſaw alſo, that all the other pretences to the Waldenſes, and the reſt, were falſe and frivolous, ſeing none of theſe agreed intirely with Proteſtants, neither had any of them perpetual continuance: and being ashamed of the Puritans inviſible Church, which we shall ſee to be a meer <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> they had no other refuge, but to flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Roman Church, which they were the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore enforced to acknowledge, to be the true Church, which had alwayes remain'd, albeit their firſt Reformers had abandonned it, as a falſe Church, accuſing it of ſuperſtition &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, as the moſt part of all viſible Proteſtants yet continue to do. But this refuge hath been shewed to ſerve them to no purpoſe. Theſe men do in a part reſemble the prodigal child, who never thought of returning to his Fathers
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:43743:152"/> houſe, till he had ſpent all h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But there was this deplorable difference, between the prodigal child and them: that he, being truly penitent and confeſſing his fault with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, was by his Father moſt lovingly met, embraced &amp; kiſſed, cloathed and feaſted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas they returning, not with humility &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for their ſeparation, but with idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and vaine accuſations, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intention, ſave only to get their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe covered, and their other vrgent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſupplyed, were neither met, nor received, clothed, nor feaſted: but have perished for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and cold, and are now almoſt all, with the decay of their late ill founded Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirpared out of the world. They called the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a ſick Church, and their own, a whole Church; yet it is verifyed, that their whole Church is dead, and hath decayed before the ſick Church. And as their Church, according to them, was only viſible in the Roman Church, before Luther: ſo it's now inviſible in it ſelf, and only viſible, as it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and like to continue ſo, vnto the end.</p>
               <p>By all which conſiderations, it is evident,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43743:152"/> that no viſible Proteſtant Church can be found before Luther, and much leſſe, a continuall ſucceſſion of it from the time of the Apoſtles. We have travailed almoſt all the world over, ſeeking this Church and we have followed diverſe Proteſtant Guides, who vndertook to shew it vnto vs; but ever in the end, they faile of their promiſes. Therefore we muſt paſſe now from the Proteſtant viſible Church, which cannot be ſeen, before Luther, to their invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, which we shall ſee cannot be found before him.</p>

               <p>Now we shall ſee, how it is againſt Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants principles, yea and deſtroyes it ſelf. For they ordinarly aſſign two neceſſary marks of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:43743:155"/> the Church, to witt: the right preaching of the word, &amp; adminiſtration of the Sacraments. To which the Preſbyterians add their diſciplin, as a third mark. I inquire then, if this Church, which ſome of them make inviſible, for 900. ſome for 1000. and others for 12. hundred years, had preaching and Sacraments, during that time; or not? If it had: then it could not be inviſible: for inviſible people can neither be inſtructed, nor baptized. If it had no preaching, nor Sacraments; then it hath been a miſerable Church, or rather no Church at all, which wanted theſe two things, which are neceſſary to conſtitute a Church. If a famous Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Miniſter took occaſion lately, whilſt he was baptizing a child, on a cold winter day, to ſay againſt the Anabaptiſts: <hi>It is cold dipping to day: I love not Sommer Sacraments:</hi> May not any one ſay more iuſtly, againſt the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians? <hi>In many dayes an inviſible Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found out.

If it had any, it could not be inviſible, as is evident: and, if that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement was Preſbyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rian diſciplin, that Church had not been only viſible, to theſe, who obey'd it, but alſo very ſenſible to thoſe, who did not willingjy ſtoop to it: or elſe it hath been very far different from the nature of our Scottish Preſbytery. If that inviſible Church had no government, then it wanted
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:43743:156"/> that, which no ſociety can want, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout which, there is no order but confuſion. Yea, this inviſible Church is ſuch a rare device, that it deſtroies it ſelf. For no Church, albeit never ſo inviſible, can be imagined without internal faith at leaſt. Now faith coms by, <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

But, in an inviſible Church, there could be no preaching or inſtruction, and ſo no faith: and no faith, no Church. Not ſo much as an inviſible one. In a word, this inviſible Church, which wanted preaching, faith, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and government, hath been a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or rather a Chimerical Church.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this inviſible Church doth highly diſparage the Chriſtian religion. For it makes the Church of Chriſt (of whoſe glory above the Synagogue of the Iewes, ſo much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scriptures) not equal in glory; but more inglorious, then the Iewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue hath been, even ſince the coming of Chriſt. For, ever ſince that time, the Iewes have profeſſed their religion, and had viſible Synagogues, in diverſe famous nations: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas the Preſbyterians make the Church of Chriſt to be inviſible, for many ages of that time, in which not one could be found, who had the courage, or devotion, to profeſſe the true religion. Now, what can be more againſt the Sriptures, and the honour of Chriſt, then this wicked device? what more opprobrious to all the Chriſtians of theſe times? God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>IT hath been already proved, that, albeit the Proteſtants had had an inviſible Church before Luther; yet it could not be the true Church, which muſt be alway's viſible. Now remaines to be shewed the ſecond thing which was vndertaken above, to witt; that, albeit an inviſible Church were ſufficient, yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants had not ſo much as one of that nature, before Luther; and ſo they ſuccumb, as well <hi>de facto,</hi> as they have done <hi>de iure;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this device of an inviſible Church, for two reaſons, will ſerve them to no purpoſe: Which is shewed thus. An inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſible Proteſtant Church, is a Church, which beleeved the Proteſtant faith in their heart, albeit they made no external profeſſion of it. But de facto there was no Church before Luther, which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Proteſtant confeſſion of faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:43743:158"/> there was no viſible Proteſtant Church, before Luth r. The Maior is evident: becauſe there is this difference between a viſible, and an inviſible Church: that the firſt profeſſeth the faith, the other profeſſeth it not: but they both agree in this, to have inwardly the faith: Without which, there cannot be any Church. Therefore an inviſible Proteſtant Church is a Church, which beleeved inwardly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant faith. The Minor is proved of the time immediatly preceeding Luthers preaching. For either Luther himſelf, before he began to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Pope, was a member of this lurking Proteſtan Church, beleeving the Proteſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt Confeſſion, or theſe, who adhered to him, were members of it, or ſome others, who did nor ioyne with him; and beſids theſe no others can be found or imagined. But none of theſe can be ſaid. For Luther is avowedly confeſſed by himſelf and all men,<note place="margin">in ad lat</note> to have been a Roman Catholique, a Prieſt, a friar of S. Auguſtins order, and, as himſelf acknowledgeth, ſaid Maſſe devoutly, and honored the Pope in his heart. Therefore Luther, before he oppoſed the Pope, did not beleeve inwardly the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant faith, and was not a member of the Prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtants lurking inviſible Church, but was a member of the Roman viſible Church. But ſo were Melanchton, Carolſtadius, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons and all the reſt, who followed him, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, or Prieſts, profeſſing the Roman religion, &amp; knowing nothing of the Proteſtant, till Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught them. Therefore all theſe, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:43743:158"/> to Luthers new doctrin, were before that time, not lurking Proteſtants; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes't Papiſts. Neither were there any other members of that ſuppos'd lurking Proteſtant Church, who did not ioyn with Luther. For, if there had been any, they should and would have come out of their lurking holes, ſo ſoon as Luther began to preach, and got the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of ſecular Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. For then there was no more feare of perſecution, which was the only reaſon, why theſe men did not profeſſe their religion. And therefore, that being taken away, if there had been any ſuch inviſible Proteſtants, they would have showen themſelvs viſible, acknowledged their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, run and ioyn'd hands with them, and ſaid: Behold this is the faith, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way's beleeved, although we did not, or durſt not profeſſe it. But no ſuch perſons did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare when they might ſafely, and ought in all duty to have appeared. Therefore there was no lurking Proteſtant Church before Luther: and conſequently, the Proteſtants had no Church at all before him, neither viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor inviſible.</p>
               <p>This may be yet further illuſtrated &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. For there may be conceived two kinds of inviſible Proteſtant Churches. The firſt is a Church, which believed in their hearts the Proteſtant faith; and yet made profeſſion of the contrary religion, to witt of Popery. The ſecond is a company of people, beleeving alſo internally the ſame faith, but making no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:43743:159"/> of a contrary religion. And between theſe two extreames there is no medium. But the Proteſtants had neither of theſe two inviſible Churches before Luther. Therefore they had none at all. Not the firſt [which, although they had, could not have been the true Church of Chriſt, or a ſociety of faithfull Chriſtians, but rather was a miſerable crue of diſſembled Sycophants; for ſo they behoved to be, who beleeved one thing, &amp; profeſſed the contrary, which they thought groſſe ſuperſtition &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry] Not the firſt, I ſay. For ſuch a diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Church behoved to beleeve the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants faith in their heart, and profeſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, againſt their conſciences. But there were none before Luther, who beleeved the Proteſtant faith in their hearts, &amp;c. becauſe Luther himſelf beleeved the Roman Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que faith in his heart, and of this, there can be no greater evidence, then his own teſtimony againſt himſelf. For he profeſſeth, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Pope for conſcience ſake, and thought, that he would have been ſevered from God, if he had been ſeparated from the Pope; and much more to this purpoſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Luther was not a diſſembled Proteſtant, but rather a ſincere Papiſt, before he began to oppoſe the Pope. Neither were there any other before him, who believed the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant faith, &amp; profeſſed the contrary: becauſe his followers were ignorant of the Proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, till Luther taught it, and shew them the light. This is witneſſed by prime Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:43743:159"/> who ſay: It's ridiculous to think,<note place="margin">Cont. Shlus. in Theol. Cal. l. <hi>2.</hi> f. <hi>131.</hi>
                  </note> that any man before Luther, did attayn vnto the true doctrin, or that he receiv'd it from others, and not others from him.

               <p>Neither had the Proteſtants that other kind of inviſible Church, before Luther; which beleeved the Proteſtant faith in their hearts, and made no profeſſion of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For firſt, Luther &amp; his followers did not beleeve it, till he oppoſed the Pope as hath been
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:43743:160"/> preſently proved. Secondly, they profeſſed themſelves, both by words &amp; actions, to be Roman Catholiques, and ſo made profeſſion of a religion, contrary to the Proteſtant, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, in both theſe conditions, this inviſible Proteſtant Church is viſibly deficient, and conſequently, there was no kind of an inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church before Luther, neither a ſincere, nor a diſſembled Church, if we will iudge of it, by the perſons, who m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>heſies of the Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church. For, writing againſt the Donatiſts, on this ſame ſubiect of the Church, he ſaith. <hi>Let vs heare ſome few things out of the Pſalms, ſo long ago ſung and foretold, and let vs now with ioy</hi> ſee <hi>them fulfil'd.</hi> Again:<note place="margin">Aug Vnit Eccl.</note> 
                  <hi>Heare this out of the Divine booke, how it was foretold, and</hi> ſee <hi>now in the world how it is at complish'd.</hi> Therefore, as there is no other way to make a propheſy true, but by fulfilling it: ſo there is
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:43743:161"/> no other way to know it to be fulfilled, but by viſible and ſenſible performance of it.</p>
               <p>By what is ſaid, may be eaſily ſeen, that the complaint of Elias, which is alway's in the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans mouth, makes nothing for their inviſible Church, before Luther. For firſt Elias was only ſpeaking of Iſrael, as a famous Proteſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,<note place="margin">Enoch. Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pham. in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidot. Schiſm. p. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> in theſe words. <hi>Our vnskilfull Reformers ſay, that the Church was inviſible in the time of Elias, but the holy Spirit teſtifyeth, that he ſpake this of Iſrael, and not of Iuda: for he knew that good Ioſaphat was reigning in Iuda, and that the Church was not only viſible there, but alſo floo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in great piety.</hi> Wherefore it is an evil pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to ſay: the Iewish Synagogue was inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a short time, in one province, albeit it was viſible at the ſame time in another. Therefore the Chriſtian Church may be, or was inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble throughout the whole world; for a thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years &amp; above. 2. Theſe, who were lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the time of Elias, bowed not their knees to <hi>Baal;</hi> which if they had done, they had not belong'd to the inviſible Church of God. But all the ſuppos'd inviſible. Proteſtants, as Luther and his followers, bowed their knees to the Maſſe, (which they eſteem Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry) as hath been shewed. Therefore they could not be the inviſible Church of God. 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe good Iſraelits were inviſible to Elias, at ſuch a diſtance, when he fled; yet he knew many of them to be viſible; both to others,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.13.</note> and among themſelves. For <hi>Abdias</hi> told him a little before, that he had hid 100.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43743:161"/> Prophets of the Lord in two Caves, where he fed them. But all Proteſtants before Luther were inviſible: both to others, and themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves. For not ſo much as one perſon knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Proteſtant, before Luther taught that religion, as hath been proved. 4. Although the whole Iewish Synagogue had been inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is moſt falſe; yet it followes not, the whole Chriſtian Church may be, or was ſo too: For this, as S. Paul teſtifyeth: is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon better promiſes. 5.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6.</note> Salvation was not altogether tyed, before Chriſt, to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish Synagogue, for there were ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Gentils, as <hi>Melchiſedeck, Iob,</hi> &amp;c. But the Preſbyterians, by making the whole Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church to be inviſible for many ages; take away all the ordinary means of ſalvation, which only can be had in the viſible Church. Laſtly. Albeit all the faithfull, both Iewes and Gentils, had been inviſible, in the time of Elias; yet this would make nothing for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: vnleſſe they had been alſo inviſible, before Luther. But <hi>de facto,</hi> there were no lurking Proteſtants before him, as hath been clearly proved. Therefore, although the Church could be inviſible, yet the Proteſtants had no inviſible Church, before Luther. And beſides the reaſons brought above againſt this inviſible Church, it may ſeem truly ſtrange, that, for ſo many ages, not ſo much as one perſon of it, was heard of, or known; never ſo much as one falſe brother could be found among them, to reveale them. And, which is
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:43743:162"/> moſt ſtrange, when this inviſible Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came viſible, not ſo much as one perſon did appeare, who had been a lurking member of it. Such groundleſſe conceipts require ſtrong imaginations to fancy them, but much more credulous hearts to beleeve them. Wherefore Elias complaint, for many reaſons, makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Proteſtants; but is cleary againſt them.</p>
               <p>So is alſo their other refuge to the Church of the predeſtinate, which they ſay was inviſible, before Luther. For 1. there is no ſuch Church, becauſe Chriſts Church is a Congregation of all true beleevers; as well reprobate, as predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate;<note place="margin">Math. ch. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; ch. <hi>13.</hi>

                  <hi>There is in his floore both wheat and chaffe:</hi> and <hi>in his field both corne &amp; tares.</hi> 2. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate are as viſible, as the reprobate; S. Peter was as viſible, as Iudas. 3. Although it were granted, there had been ſome inviſible Predeſtinate, before Luther; yet none of them could be Proteſtants, becauſe none believed the Proteſtant faith, till Luther taught it; as hath been proved. 4. Either theſe ſuppoſed Proteſtants before Luther, profeſſed their faith, or not? If they profeſſed it, then they were not inviſible.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.</note> If they profeſs'd it not, then they were not predeſtinate. For <hi>with our heart,</hi> ſaith S. Paul, <hi>we beleeve vnto iuſtice, and with our mouth Confeſſion is made to ſalvation.</hi> 5. It is at leaſt requiſite, that the predeſtinate should not deny their faith, if they will not confeſſe it; or elſe they cannot be predeſtinate. But all the ſuppoſed inviſible Proteſtants, before Luther,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:43743:162"/> denyed their faith, by profeſſing Popery, as hath been shewed.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19.</note> Therefore they could not be predeſtinate. Laſtly, hereſies and perſecution make the predeſtinate more conſpicuous. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,</hi> ſaith S. Paul, <hi>muſt be, that theſe, who are approved, be made manifeſt among you.</hi> Who are more approved before God then the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? Who are made more manifeſt before men, then they, eſpecially when hereſy &amp; perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do ariſe? For then, by their cloſe adhereing to the true faith, and their profeſſion of it [whereas others, either through error or feare fall from it) they are rendred more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the Scripture shewes; and therefore they are not made hid &amp; inviſible, as the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans do alleadge. Hence it is, that the Church is ſo far from being inviſible in the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, more then in others; that, vpon the contrary, when that might happen in others, either by error, infirmity, or feare of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the true Church shall be moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the predeſtinate,<note place="margin">Aug. epiſt. <hi>48.</hi> ad Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</note> and is principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in them. For then, as S. Auguſtin ſpeaks <hi>In ſuis firmiſſimis eminet: she shines in her moſt ſtedfaſt members.</hi> Predeſtination indeed is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſo is reprobation: but the predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate are as viſible, as the reprobate; yea,<note place="margin">Mel. in locis com. cap. de Eccleſ.</note> they are the moſt eminent members of the viſible Church, out of which they cannot be found, as Melanchton confeſſeth. <hi>Let vs not dreame,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the elect can be found any where, but in the viſible Society of the Church.</hi> But the Proteſtants had no viſible Church before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:43743:163"/> therefore they had no predeſtinate; and ſo many wayes this Babel is overturned. The Apoſtles, and all the ancient Chriſtians, who were predeſtinate, were members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, and profeſſed their faith in the time of the Heathen perſecutions, which were more cruel &amp; vniverſal, then any, that has hapned ſince. They had not Giges ring, to make themſelves inviſible; not the black arte of diſſembling in religion, as the inviſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants (if there were any) behoved to have: which are qualities very vnbeſeeming the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate.</p>
               <p>By all which, it remaines ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Proteſtant Church cannot be the true Church. For to reſume briefly the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The true Church muſt have ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſince the aſcenſion of Chriſt to this time. But the Proteſtant Church hath only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſince the revolt of Luther. Therefore the Proteſtant Church is not the true Church. There is nothing more certain then the Maior. The Minor hath been proved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if there had been any Proteſtant Church, before Luther; it had been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible or inviſible. But there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Not the firſt: becauſe there was no Church nor perſon, before Luther, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed entirely any Proteſtant Confeſſion, for any little time, much leſſe for the whole time, between, the Apoſtles &amp; Luther. Not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: becauſe, if there had been any inviſible Proteſtant Church before Luther, it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43743:163"/> viſible, when Luther appeared, and the feare of perſecution was taken away. But no ſuch inviſible Church did then appeare. And moreover, it hath been shewed, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Proteſtants had had an inviſible Church before Luther; yet it could not be the true Church, which ought to be alwayes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and that an inviſible Church is againſt Scriptures, Fathers, reaſon, Proteſtants own principles, diſparageth the Chriſtian religion; gives great advantage to Iewes and infidels; and leads men into Apoſtaſy and Atheiſm. And ſo both the holes of <hi>Viſibility</hi> and <hi>Inviſibility,</hi> by which theſe foxes were accuſtomed to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, are now lay'd, or ſtop't. The diverſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaies, which many Proteſtants make to find their Church, shew the difficulty of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo that they ſee, what they ought not to ſay, but cannot ſee what to ſay, that hath any probability of truth. They have travailed much to find out their Church, before Luther; they have been above theſe 100. years in ſeeking it, and we have followed the moſt famous Guides among them. But both they &amp; we have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vaine, to find that, which cannot be found. Yet we make much profit of our labour, if we have diſcovered, that the Proteſtant Church before Luther, cannot be found, not becauſe it was hid, but becauſe it was not, as hath been proved: and therefore leave off any further ſearch of it; following S. Auguſtins advice, who writes thus to the Donatiſts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the like purpoſe. <hi>Some thing,</hi> ſaith he,

                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> That the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, and she alone, is the true Church.</head>
               <p>HAVING already proved, to your ſatisfaction, (ſaid my Catholique friend to me) your Church not to be the true Church, and that, by the vndenyable principle of the perpetuity of the Church; I will now endeavour, with the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, to prove no leſſe clearly, by the ſame principle, laying aſide other proofs, the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, and her alone, to be the true Church. Which I briefly do, after this manner.</p>
               <p>That is the only true Church, which has had
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43743:164"/> a continued ſucceſſion from Chriſt &amp; his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to this time.</p>
               <p>But the Church in Communion with the ea of Rome, and she alone has had a continued ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſion from Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles to this time.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, and no other, is the true Church.</p>
               <p>The Maior is clear. For to have a continued ſucceſſion, &amp; to be perpetuall, is the ſame thing. Now, as we have ſeen above, that the true Church muſt be perpetual, or muſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually endured from Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles to this time; ſo it is no leſſe evident, that that is only the true Church, which has been perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, or has ſtill endured. This the holy Fathers do teſtify: this the light of reaſon doth evince. S. Hierom ſaith:<note place="margin">Hieron. Dial. cont. Lucifer.</note> 
                  <hi>I will bring a short and clear declaration of my mind, that we ought to remain in that Church, which, being founded by the Apoſtles, endures even vnto this day.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe we ought to remain in the true Church: and that, according to S. Hierom, is the true Church, which hath ſtill endured from the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Tertull. lib. <hi>4.</hi> contr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> To the like purpoſe Tertullian ſaith: <hi>That is true, which is firſt: that is firſt, which was from the beginning: that is from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which was from the Apoſtles.</hi> And therefore that is the true Church, which has continued from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>This ſame truth is alſo cleared by the light of reaſon. For the true Church was firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, before any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43743:165"/> or falſe Churches, which carie the name of Chriſtian, were, or could be raiſed by hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques. Becauſe truth is alway's before falshood, the body is before the shaddow, and the good ſeed is ſow'n in the field, before the <hi>tares.</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, that is the true Church, which was firſt and from the beginning: and conſequently that is the only true Church, which hath been perpetual; for that only could be firſt &amp; from the beginning. Moreover, this truth is confirmed. For it is certain, that <hi>de facto</hi> no hereſies or falſe Churches have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from the primitive times: becauſe theſe, which aroſe of old, have long ago evanished; and theſe, which remain to this day, have but for a short time endured. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, if it be moſt certain, that the true Church muſt be perpetual: then it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo certain, that that only is the true Church, which has been perpetual; ſince one only Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church hath been perpetual. Yea, albeit any hereſy had continued even from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient &amp; primitive times (as never any of them, by Gods ſpecial providence, can ſee ſo many dayes) yet it could not be perpetual; becauſe it could not be firſt, and from the beginning, which only the true Church can be (as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ſeen) but it behoved to be raiſed thereafter by heretiques, and therefore could not be ſo ancient as the true Church: and conſequently had not perpetually endured. By all which, the Maior of our argument is ſufficiently cleared.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:43743:165"/>
               <p>The Minor, to witt, that the Church now in Communion with the ſea of Rome, and she alone has ſtill endured, or has had a continued ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this time, is proved by all the evidences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuch a propoſition can be proved, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby the holy Fathers proved it in their times. For all hiſtories, all Monuments &amp; records, publique fame, the Conſent of people &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, as S. Auguſtin ſpeaks, the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mankind bear witneſſ, that this Church, and she alone, has had a continued ſucceſſion. For this was the Church, which in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times ſuffered and overcame all the cruel perſecutions of the Iewes &amp; Pagans; this is the Church, which hath converted Kings &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from infidelity to Chriſtianity: which hath had her gates continually open, day &amp; night, in all generations, to receive the ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth of the Gentils: and, in a word, which has made the world Chriſtian. This is the Church, which alone in all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ges has oppoſed all the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, which did ariſe in their diverſe ages, from the beginning of Chriſtianity; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they all have shut out their hornes againſt this Church, and both by ſlight &amp; might have endeavoured to deſtroy her; yet she alone hath fought againſt them all, and gloriouſly trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over them all. This is the Church, which has held all the General Councels; which hath condemned all errors and hereſies; which has had Paſtors and people profeſſing the faith in all ages, without interruption, and in
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:43743:166"/> which all the Saints, Martyrs and Doctors have lived. Theſe things might be shown, by a particular Catalogue of this Churches chief Paſtors, Councils, Nations converted, and publique Profeſſors in every age; if it were not too longſome: and beſids it is ſo clear, that it is not here neceſſary, eſpecially ſeing the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran Centuriſts, who have raked together all they can, both for themſelves, and againſt the Roman Church, yet can shew the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and continuance of no other, but only of this Church. And the reaſon of this is clear: becauſe this Church, and she alone, hath ſo clearly this ſucceſſion, that no other Churches, which carie the name of Chriſtian, can ſo much as pretend to have it, in the leaſt degree of probability. For it is evidently certain, that all other Churches, which are ſeparated from this Church, were once of her faith &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and went vndeniably out of her, and therefore, they cannot be ſo ancient as she; and conſequently they have not alwayes had a continued ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles; and, if they pretended it, they would be moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, making an evident lie againſt ſenſe. Therefore the Proteſtants wiſely pretend no ſuch thing. Yea their whole Reformation is grounded vpon a contrary pretext: that the whole Church had fallen into deſolation, groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Errors, Hereſy and Idolatry, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indeed to pretend, that the ſucceſſion of the Church had failed, and that they were now ſent, to ſet her vp again. By all which, it is ſeen
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43743:166"/> that the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, and she alone, has had a continued ſucceſſion from Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles: and that ſo clearly, that no other Church can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have it.</p>
               <p>This ſame truth was teſtifyed by the holy Fathers, in their time. S. Hierom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>who leaves the Chaire of Peter, vpon whom the Church was built, does he think to be in the Church?</hi> But let vs hear S. Auguſtin, the moſt glorious Doctor of the Church, shewing this ſame truth. For, after he had ſpoken much of the ſincere wiſdom, great holyneſſe and fruits of piety, of the Church, and of the great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:43743:167"/> which God hath conferr'd on her: he ſubioyns theſe remarkable words to his friend <hi>Honoratus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de vtilite crede c. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Seing therefore we ſee ſo great help and aſsiſtance from God, shall we make any doubt or queſtion at all, of retiriing into the boſome of that Church, which, to the Confeſsion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, from the ſea Apoſtolique by the ſucceſsion of Bishops, hath obtain'd the Soveraignity, &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal authority, Heretiques in vain barking round about it: being condemned partly by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Councels, partly alſo by the Maieſty &amp; ſplendour of Miracles? vnto which, not to grant the chief place, is either indeed an extream im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, or a very rash and dangerous arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> Thus he. Here we ſee, what Church in the time of the holy Fathers had this continued ſucceſſion: and the ſame is no leſſe evident to this day. In the Scriptures we read the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and Chriſts promiſes of his Church; and in this Church alone, we ſee no leſſe cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly the performances. What the Scripture had foretold,<note place="margin">Aug. de vnitate Eccl. c. <hi>8.</hi> &amp; in pſ. <hi>149.</hi>
                  </note> here with ioy, as S. Auguſtin ſpeaks, we may ſee fulfilled. The Church before was only read in books, and now it is ſeen in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>By all which authorities &amp; evidences, both the Maior and the Minor of the argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed are ſufficiently proved to be manifeſt truths, to witt: That that is only the true Church, which has had a continued ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Apoſtles to this time. And that the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, and she alone, has had a continued ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:43743:167"/> From which the Concluſion followes clearly. Therefore the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome is the only true Church of Chriſt. You ſee this reaſon is neither new, nor obſcure: For it was vſed by the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as a moſt clear, short and convincing way, whereby the true Church may be known. If it was ſo eaſy &amp; ſtrong then, it is no leſſe, but rather more evident &amp; forcible now. If the ſucceſſion of the Church for 3. or 4. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and of 30. or 40. Roman Bishops was eſteem'd ſo ſtrong by the Fathers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the true Church: how much more forcible is the ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, for above 1600. yeares, &amp; above 2. hundred Bishops of the ſea Apoſtolique, to prove the ſame truth? Nothing could be ſaid by the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers, in confirma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this truth, which may not as iuſtly be ſaid now: and nothing can be pretended now by the preſent Enemies of the Roman Church, againſt it, which might not have been as iuſtly prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by her ancient enemies, the old heretiques. Neither is there any way to shun the force of this Demonſtration, but either by affirming, that the true Church had perished (which is deteſtable blaſphemy) or by ſaying she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inviſible, which we have shown above to be a groſſe falshood, and deſperate folly.</p>
               <p>This whole matter may be further illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and confirmed. There is nothing more clear in the Scripture, then that the Church of Chriſt muſt ſtill endure, or have a continued ſucceſſion of people, profeſſing the ſame faith,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43743:168"/> which was taught by the Apoſtles. Now, it is no leſſe clear, &amp; it is granted by all Chriſtians, that the Church in Communion with Rome had once this ſucceſſion, and profeſſed the true faith, at leaſt for ſome years, after the Apoſtles. Therefore, either she holds ſtill the ſame true faith, and ſo has a continued ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Apoſtles; or elſe, if she hath fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l'd, ſome other Church hath ſucceeded, and kept the true faith in all generations thereafter. But no other Church can be aſſigned, which hath ſtill ſucceeded. Therefore, either the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, which was once vndenyably the true Church, is ſtill the true Church, and hath ever profeſſed the ſame true faith, or elſe the true Church of Chriſt, which ought to be perpetual and viſible, hath perished out of the earth, for many ages: which no Chriſtian can affirm. Moreover, as the true Church is clearly &amp; eaſily known, by her continued ſucceſſion; ſo all falſe Churches are evidently diſcoverd, by their new riſing.<note place="margin">S.

                  </note> The moſt ancient Father, S.

               <p>But it is worth the obſervation, and much illuſtrates this matter, to conſider, what two contrary things the Scripture foretells of the true Church, and of hereſies. Of the Church, it shewes, that it hath no later beginning then Chriſt, who founded it; and can end no ſooner, then the conſummation of the world. Both theſe truths are contain'd in that one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Chriſt, to ſpeak of no more.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Vpon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Of ſects &amp; hereſies it shewes iuſt the contrary. 1. They are not ſo ancient as Chriſt, but ariſe afterwards, as S. Paul foretold the Epheſians, ſaying: <hi>I know,</hi>

                  <hi>They shall proſper no further.</hi> The firſt two are verifyed clearly in the Catholique Church, which, being founded by Chriſt, hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to this day without interruption, and ſo shall continue vnto the end of the world. For
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:43743:169"/> this, being the work of God, cannot be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as Gamaliel wiſely or rather divinly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. The other two are no leſſe verifyed of all falſe Churches. For they began of late in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages, after the Apoſtles: and, albeit they ſeem'd ſometimes firmly eſtablished, yet, being the works &amp; devices of men, they were ever at length diſſolved. The firſt point, to witt late riſing, is verifyd of the Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which were not known before Luther; &amp; their diſſenſions, changes, diviſions and ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, which every day encreaſe, and for which there is no remedie, shew, that they cannot endure for ever. Is it not then truly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, that the hereſies, which have riſen againſt the Church, being ſo many in number (for two hundred Hereſiarchs, are reckoned to have been before Luther &amp; ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpheld by great earthly power, &amp; maintain'd by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſvbtile and crafty wits, covered with the mask of truth, and promoved with furious zeal) yet never one of them hath endured? And vpon the other part, the Catholique Church, being all alone, ſo ancient, ſo much hated, ſo much calumniated and perſecuted by them all, hath ſtood out againſt them all, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures vnto this day? Is it not very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that all heretiques, having intended by ſlight and might the deſtruction of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, which ſome of them have moſt cruelly perſecuted, and the building of their own new reſpective Churches; yet they could never get either of theſe two deſigns accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43743:169"/> For the Catholique Church, being founded by Chriſt vpon a rock, cannot be shaken. Whereas theſe new Churches, albeit ſometimes they ſeem to be brought neer vnto ſome ſetling &amp; perfection; yet before they can get on the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtone</hi> (for which the Preſbyterians did often in vain cry) fall ever into ruin and confuſion. Who will conſider theſe things, &amp; may not ſee the finger of God in protection of his Church, &amp; the clear performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all his promiſes vnto her? And vpon the other part, who may not ſee an evident curſe fall vpon all hereſies, which like Babels, can never be perfited, &amp; being built vpon the ſand, cannot long ſtand, or being like adulterous plants, cannot take deep rootes?</p>
               <p>But, that you may diſcern the better, how the true Church is ſo eaſily known, by her continued ſucceſſion; &amp; all falſe Churches are ſo clearly diſcovered by their new riſing; I pray yow conceive in your mind theſe follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing repreſentations, which are grounded in the Scriptures &amp; holy Fathers. 1. Repreſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelf the true Church as a great River, paſſing from one end of the earth to the other, running continually from the time of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, through all generations. And ſuch is the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, having ſucceſſion of Paſtors &amp; people in all ages, like a river ever running, in which all the Saints, as living waters, have flowed vnto paradiſe. But heretical Churches are like little <hi>brooks,</hi> or <hi>rainfloods,</hi> not alway's running, but riſing at ſeveral times, after ſtormes &amp;
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43743:170"/> tempeſts, not compaſſing the earth, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſome petty corners of it, making for a short ſpace a great noiſe, thereafter, running more calmly, and in end clean dried vp. S. Auguſtin makes this compariſon, for on theſe words of the pſalme.<note place="margin">Aug. in pſal. <hi>57.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>They shall come to nothing as water running down,</hi> he ſaith: <hi>Let not, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſome floods which are called Torrents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright you: the water runs down for a time, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes a great noiſe, it shall ſoon ceaſe, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure long Many hereſies are now dead they have run in their ſtreams, as much as they could, they have run out, their waters are dried vp, ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely the memorie of them is to be found &amp;c.</hi> Thus he. You know that the Covenant did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways run, and after it began how furiouſly it ran, what great noiſe it made, how it carried down almoſt all with it. Now you ſee it runs mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re calmly: it is almoſt run out and the great noiſe of it, is paſt.</p>
               <p>Again, the true Church is like the Sun, ever shining in all generations, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He hath put his tabernacle in the Sun:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal</hi> 18.6.</note> which S. Auguſtin expounds thus: <hi>He hath placed his Church in manifeſtation.</hi> And ſuch has been the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, always viſible and ever shining, ſince the time of Chriſt. But all hereſies are like Comets, which ariſe at certain times, &amp; being made vp of terreſtrial vapours, make a great blaze ſo long as their groſſe matter laſts; but ſo ſoo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as that failes, they quickly evanish. So indeed are hereſies made vp for the moſt part of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary intereſts, which make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for a short time,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:43743:170"/> give a great gliſter; but ſo ſoon as the groſſe matter of theſe intereſts failes, as it cannot laſte long, then they begin to shine dimnly: then they languish, &amp; in end evanish. How great a light was the Covenant eſteem'd? What a great luſtre did it make in great Britain, ſo long as the intereſts concurred? But theſe ſoon fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, new lights have riſen, which have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the former to be meerly humane, have made it to languish, and in a word have shown it to be a Comet.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Church of Chriſt is frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly compared by the holy Fathers, to a <hi>ship</hi> ſtrongly built, and wiſely governed by Chriſt; which ever ſince his time hath ſailed through the ſeas of this world; and notwithſtanding the many tempeſts, which the Divel and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men have raiſd againſt her; yet she riding out them all, hath carried in her all theſe, who have been ſaved, vnto the port of Salvation. She has been many wayes toſſed, but could never be overwhelmed. For,<note place="margin">Ambroſ lib. de Salomo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> as S. Ambroſe ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently: <hi>She cannot ſuffer ship shipwrak, becauſe Chriſt is exalted on the maſt, that is on the Croſſe, the Father ſits pilot in the ſterne, and the holy Ghoſt preſerves the fore-Caſtle.</hi> Such is the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, as we have ſeen. But heretical Churches are like little boats, neither made, nor governed by Chriſt, but by new Sect-Maſters, who foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly abandoned the ship of the Church. Who promiſe a ſafe and more eaſy paſſage to heaven, whereby many are rashly drawn, to entruſt
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:43743:171"/> their ſoules to them. But within a short ſpace, the ſtormes ariſing, theſe new vnskifull Pilots, being of contrary iudgments, fall into horrible diſſenſions, and their paſſingers into bloody factions, to the deſtruction of one another. So that in end, theſe boats, which came but lately vpon the ſea of this world, which intended fondly to ſink the Church, are das't againſt rocks &amp; ſplit in pieces: and all theſe miſerable ſoules, which remain'd in them, are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with waters.<note place="margin">Hieron. epiſt. ad Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> For <hi>whoſoever,</hi> ſaith S. Hierom, <hi>is not in the ark of Noah shall perish by the raging deluge.</hi> And thus all falſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, after a little time, have perished.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the Church is compared by Chriſt vnto a houſe built by himſelf, as by a wiſe Maſter-builder, vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wherefore to conclude, I hope now through Gods goodneſſe, that you, having ſeen ſuch evidence for the truth of the Roman Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church, will make your ſelf a domeſtique of this heavenly houſe, which can never be shaken: that you will enter into this ship, which can ſuffer no shipwrack: that you will walk in this light, that can never be eclipſed; and that you will runn this channel, wherein all the Saints have pas't vnto paradiſe. To this purpoſe ſpake the Catholique.</p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:43743:171"/>
               <p>After I had conſidered diligently all theſe things, which were given me thereafter in writing, and had ſeen, that this reaſon was ſo well grounded in the Scriptures, and was vſed by the holy Fathers, as a moſt clear and convincing way to prove the true Church; I was much ſatisfyed therewith. But yet I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Catholique, if he would fully ſatisfie me, to shew, that the Roman Catholique Church had never changed her doctrin, and had ſtill kept that ſame which she had received from the Apoſtles. For I doubt not, ſaid I, but you know, that the Miniſters accuſe her to have fallen from the Apoſtolique doctrin, in many points, and to have brought in many corruptions. Wherevnto he anſwered, that, by proving the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, and her alone to have had a continued ſucceſſion, he had proved clearly, her to be the true Church: and ſo conſequently to haue ſtil retained the ſame doctrin, which was taught by Chriſt and the Apoſtles: for change of doctrin changeth the Church, and ſo the doctrin being changed, the Church had not continued. But, ſaid he, for your more full ſatisfaction, to take away all doubts, and to diſpell the miſts of theſe calumnies, I will prove the ſame truth by another ſpecial way.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> That the Church in communion with the ſea of Rome, holds now, and has still held the ſame doctrin, which was taught firſt by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles.</head>
               <p>ALBEIT this truth hath been ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly proved, by the continued ſucceſſion of the Church; yet now, it shall be demonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the ſpecial manner, whereby this Church has received and ſtill conveighed all her doctrin: and, for more clearneſſe, I frame my reaſon thus.</p>
               <p>That Church, which in all ages believed nothing, as the doctrin of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, but what she received from her immediat Anceſtors, as their doctrin; holds, and hath ſtill held the true doctrin of Chriſt &amp; his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
               <p>But the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, &amp; she alone, hath in all ages received all her doctrin after that manner.</p>
               <p>Therefore she alone holds, and hath ſtill held the true doctrin, which was firſt taught by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles: and conſequently she has never changed the doctrin, which she firſt received.</p>
               <p>The Maior is proved after this manner. That Church, which in all ages believes the ſame doctrin, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:43743:172"/> taught in the firſt age, hath ever held the true doctrin of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles. But that Church which believes nothing, as Chriſts doctrin, but what she received as ſuch, from her immediat Anceſtors, believes, in all ages, the ſame doctrin, which Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles taught in the firſt age. Therefore that Church, which receives ſo her doctrin, has ever held the ſame doctrin, which was taught at firſt by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles. The reaſon of this vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of doctrin in all ages, is, becauſe that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of receiving no doctrin, as the doctrin of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, but what was delivered immediatly by the Chriſtians of the preceeding age, makes the doctrin of every following age, the ſame, with the doctrin of the preceeding age; and ſo makes the doctrin of all after ages, the ſame with the doctrin of the firſt age. For, ſuppoſe that the Church, now in this age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies vpon that principle, to believe nothing as Chriſts doctrin, but what her predeceſſors of the 15. age taught her, to be his doctrin: it is evident, that the doctrin of theſe two ages will be the ſame. And the Church of the 15. age, relying vpon the ſame principle, muſt hold the ſame doctrin, which the Church of the 14. age held; and ſo vpward, the doctrin of the third age will be the ſame, with that of the ſecond, and the doctrin of the ſecond, will be the ſame, with that of the firſt; and ſo, if this principle has been carefully obſerved in all ages, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of all ages will be the ſame, with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the firſt age, which is the doctrin of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:43743:173"/> Chriſt and of his Apoſtles. The Maior then is evident.</p>
               <p>The Minor is proved thus. The Church now in Communion with the Roman ſea, holds in this age, that principle. For she profeſſeth to believe nothing contrary to the doctrin of her immediat Anceſtors, and preſumes to add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as Chriſts doctrin, vnto the doctrin of her Anceſtors. Therefore she profeſſeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, as Chriſts doctrin, but what she received as ſuch, from her immediat An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. If the Church of the preſent age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth ſo, as it is evident she doth; then the Church of the fifteenth age behoved to make the like profeſſion, or elſe the Church of this age could not make it. For ſo many perſons, as are now in Communion with the Roman Church, cannot concurre, to make ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; ſenſible a lye, as to ſay they profeſſe nothing, but what was profes't and taught by their immediat Anceſtors; if theſe, of the 15. age, had not made truly ſuch a profeſſion of the ſame doctrines. And, for the ſame reaſon, theſe of the 15. age could not make that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and teach it vnto this age, vnleſſe the 14. age had done the ſame, and ſo you may aſcend vpward even vnto the firſt age. Therefore the Church profeſſing, to obſerve this principle, now in this age, hath profes't it alwayes. If she has profes't it alwayes, she has alſo obſerv'd it alwayes, for the ſame reaſon: becauſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, as are in Commmunion of the Roman Church, cannnot make ſo notorious a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:43743:173"/> lye, as to ſay they believe nothing, but what they received from their immediat Anceſtors, if they believed any thing elſe, as Chriſts doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, which they had not received. Therefore, ſeing they affirm, in all ages, even vnto the firſt, that they received all their doctrin, from their Anceſtors, it muſt be true that they did receive it all, and it muſt be alſo true, that, with the other doctrine, they received and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this principle: <hi>To believe nothing, but what has been delivered by their immediat Anceſtors:</hi> For this is, as it were, the rule &amp; ground of all particular doctrines So that, by proving, that the preſent Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, profeſſeth to obſerve this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; it's proved she profes't it alwayes, and by proving, that she profeſt it alwayes it is shown, she has obſerv'd it alwayes: and this principle been alwayes profes't and obſerved, it has been ever delivered, with the reſt of the doctrin, as the main ground, whereon the Church hath relyed; by which men may come vnto the ſure knowledge &amp; poſſeſſion of the true doctrin, which was taught by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles. So that, if the whole Church hath not made a notorious, ſenſible lye, in one age, to damn themſelves and their whole poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, she hath ever received all her doctrin from her immediat Anceſtors, and ſo it will be true, that the doctrin of all ages is the ſame with the doctrin of the firſt age, which is the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles. Now it reſts to be shown, that this Church alone obſerves the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:43743:174"/> former principle: which is eaſily done. For, if there had been any other ſociety of Chriſtians, which had conſtantly kept that principle, it had alſo kep't the ſame doctrin, which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church keeps, as is evident, by what hath been ſaid. Secondly, No other Churches, and eſpecially the Proteſtant, can ſo much as pretend to keep this principle. For they are ſo far from profeſſing, to receive all their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, from their immediat Anceſtors; that, at their firſt riſing, they accuſe their Anceſtors, and the Church, in their time, of Errors; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof they profeſſe themſelves to be Reformers, and that not by doctrin, which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived immediatly from others; but what they had received, or pick't out from the Scriptures, by their private collections; which has been the ordinary cuſtom of all heretiques. And this is evident in Proteſtants, who do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they have their doctrin, not by the teſtimony of the age immediatly preceeding Luther; but from him, who oppoſed the whole Church, in his time, and for many ages before him; which he pretended to reform, by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The whole ſtrength of this proof is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon this manifeſt truth, that a full report, from whole worlds of fathers, to whole worlds of Sons, of ſuch things, as they heard and ſaw, is altogether infallible; ſince ſenſible evidence, in a world of eye witneſſes, vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly concurring, is altogether infallible. And ſuch is the teſt mony of the whole Church
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43743:174"/> in every age, for her doctrin: that it is the very ſame which was delivered by Chriſt and his, Apoſtles; and therefore it was truly delivered by them. For neither can the Church be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, in this teſtimonie: ſince whole Nations cannot be deceived, in what is told them, not once, or twice, but what is dayly beaten into their ears, what they are bred with, and what they ſee dayly with their eyes, or elſe we may ſay the whole world erres, in iudging white from black. Neither can all the Chriſtians in the world, diſperſed through ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, malitiouſly conſpire to make ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a lie, as to ſay they heard this taught, and ſaw it practiſed, if they had not ſeen and heard it: For that were to teſtify a lie, in a matter, ſubiect to ſenſe, againſt their greateſt intereſt, to witt the Salvation of themſelvs &amp; of their poſterity. If it be impoſſible that all the perſons of a great Citie, and much more of a whole Nation should think &amp; affirm, that they ſaw and heard ſuch things, which truly they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw nor heard. How much more is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that all Chriſtians, Cities &amp; Nations should think and affirm, they were inſtructed in ſuch doctrines, &amp; ſaw ſuch practices: if it were not really true, that they had received theſe doctrines, &amp; ſeen theſe practices?</p>
               <p>Hence it remaines evident, that this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued teſtimony of ſo many Chriſtian, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry generation, is a moſt ſure &amp; infallible way, to attayn vnto the certain knowledge of what doctrin Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles taught: and that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:43743:175"/> the Catholique Church, by her conſtant trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this way, has ſtill held the ſame true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, which she firſt received, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently has never changed her doctrin nor brought in corruption, as the Miniſters do ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate. And therefore their pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, having no other ground but this calumnie, is a groundleſſe imagination, and a deſtruction of Chriſts true doctrin.</p>
               <p>But, that the truth of this whole matter may yet more fully appear, I will shew you briefly, that this conſtant teſtimony is the only ſure &amp; infallible way, to attayn vnto the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge &amp; poſſeſſion of our Saviours true doctrin: that it is alſo moſt eaſy &amp; vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, for all ſorts of perſons: that the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; primitive Church did follow it: and that all Errors &amp; hereſies have been clearly confuted by it.</p>
               <p>We have already show'n, that this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is a ſure &amp; infallible means: now, that it is only ſure &amp; infallible,<note place="margin">Aug. cont. ep. fond. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> is shewed. For, if there were any other, it would be the Scripture, as Proteſtants pretend. But that cannot be. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot beleeve the Scripture, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout the teſtimony of the Church, as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin clearly avoucheth. 2. Albeit we could know it without that teſtimony, yet, by the Scripture, we cannot know the whole doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of Chriſt, eſpecially ſince the Scripture it ſelf ſaith:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſal.</hi> 2.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Hold faſt the Tradition.</hi> Thirdly &amp; principally, Albeit the Scripture contain'd the whole doctrin of Chriſt; yet, how shall I
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43743:175"/> know aſſuredly, by the letter of the Scripture, the true ſenſe of it, without which I have not the true doctrin of Chriſt. Yea, I may corrupt the Scripture, or follow thoſe, who corrupt it; as S. Peter shewes many do, vnto their own perdition. Here many, if not all Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are perplexed, to show, how by the Scripture, the true ſenſe of it may be had. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſay that the Scripture is clear in all things neceſſary to Salvation, ſo that every man may eaſily vnderſtand them. Others think that the Scripture is not ſo clear, but an Interpreter is neceſſary. But they are divyded in aſſigning this Interpreter. Some ſay the Scripture, in one place, expounds it ſelf, in another: Others aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the private Spirit; and laſt of all, ſome aſſign for an Interpreter, every mans natural reaſon. But all theſe are falſe &amp; frivolous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. For firſt, they could never shew, what theſe neceſſary points are. Beſides, this is an open confeſſion, that, by the Scripture, we cannot know aſſuredly our Saviours doctrin in theſe points, which they call, not neceſſary. Then, is not the true belief of the Sacrament neceſſary for the Church? and yet we ſee, what contrary gloſſes the Lutherans &amp; Calviniſts make, on our Saviours clear words. Laſtly, if there needed no Interpreter, for things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; every one although vnlearned, who could but read, might pick out what are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, which troubles the moſt learned heads among them to find out; and theſe, who could not read, behoved to pin their implicit faith at
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:43743:176"/> at other mens ſleeves. Now, what confuſion would this make? what vncertainty would there be, in this caſe, of our Saviours doctrin? And how contrary are theſe things to truth and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, to Proteſtants principles &amp; practices? So it is evident, that by the Scripture alone, we cannot come to the ſure and infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Saviours doctrin. Neither can we attayn to it, by the Scripture, aſſiſted by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, which Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts aſſign. For it is falſe, that the Scripture expounds it ſelf, it being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in many places, which are not interpreted by others more plaine, as may appear, beſides other reaſons, by the Proteſtants diſſenſſions in many points. The conference of places, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the like, which ſome require to be ioyn'd with the Scripture, are but humane helps, ſubiect to error, and not infallible. Then for the private Spirit, it can give vs as little aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the ſenſe, as it can of the letter of the Scripture. We ſee what contrariety is among thoſe, who all equally lay claim to it. Neither is the laſt Interpreter, to witt every mans reaſon [aſſigned by <hi>M. Chilingworth,</hi> the laſt peaceable Refiner of the English Church) any white better, but rather worſe. For, beſids that this opinion makes humane reaſon, &amp; not the divine authority, the main ground of our faith, which is a dangerous errour; it is ſo far from bringing men vnto the ſure knowledge of what our Saviour taught, that it profeſſeth no more but a moral certainty, for the truth of the whole Chriſtian religion; and leaves all
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43743:176"/> particular doctrines, to be pickt out of the Scriptures, according to the diverſity of mens particular reaſons. And ſo, diuerſe men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of their reaſons, collect from the Scriptures, oppoſite doctrines. For what ſome think reaſonable &amp; accept, others eſteem vnreaſonable, and reiect as is evident in the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny the divinity of Chriſt principally vpon this ground, becauſe it chokes their reaſon: as the Calviniſts alſo chiefly for the ſame reaſon, deny the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. So that this Interpreter brings as great vncertainty, to know our Saviours doctrin, as any other. And therefore, it remaines evident, that the Scripture even aſſiſted by any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter which Proteſtants can aſſigne, &amp; much more the Scripture alone, is not a ſure &amp; infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible means for this end; and conſequently the teſtimony of the Church is the only ſure &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible means.</p>
               <p>But here I did enquire of the Catholique. If the Scriptures were as cleer every where, as S. Auguſtin affirmes, they are concerning the Church, where he ſaith: they need no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, might they not then give vs vndoubted aſſurance of our Saviours doctrin? To which he anſwered: That although the Scripture were never ſo clear, and as evident in every ſentence, as words can be written; Yet, becauſe theſe words may be diverſly vnderſtood, &amp; taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſenſes, they cannot be ſo ſure &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible away to certifie vs, what was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours doctrin, as the living words &amp; teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:43743:177"/> of the whole Church, which received the true doctrin and the ſenſe, together with the letter of the Scriptures, which she hath conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly tranſmitted vnto poſterity. This is evident in a very principal point of the Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to witt, the holy Sacrament. What words can be more clear then theſe of our Saviour: <hi>This is my body which shall be given for you, &amp;c</hi> And yet, vpon theſe clear words, there are reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred diverſe interpretations, ſince Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts aroſe? How then should a man, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuch variety of ſenſes come vnto the true ſenſe &amp; be ſure, that he has attayn'd vnto it, in which only Chriſts true doctrin conſiſts? The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it is evident, in this caſe, that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word cannot do it, and this only the Church can perform, which has conſerved, both the letter and ſenſe of the Scriptures, from corruptions. If then the Scriptures, although they were written in moſt cleer words, cannot certifie vs fully of the true ſenſe of our Saviours doctrin: how much leſſe can they, as they are now, being in many places hard and obſcure? Theſe Proteſtants, who reiect all but Scripture, would make Chriſt to have been the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Lawgiver, that ever was in ths world, to have left vs only a written law, or a book in many things very obſcure, and expoſe it to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, to ſcance vpon, without aſſigning an Interpreter, who could give vs full aſſurance of the true ſenſe of it. That way would never bring men to the ſure knowledge of Chriſts doctrine, and the true ſenſe of his law: but
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:43743:177"/> would make all things vncertain, and bring in a confuſion more worthy of <hi>Babel,</hi> then of the houſe of God. But his divine wiſdom hath otherwiſe provyded.</p>
               <p>We haue ſeen then, ſaid the Catholique, that the teſtimony of all Chriſtians in every genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the only ſure &amp; infallible way: Now we shall ſee that it is the moſt eaſy &amp; vniverſal way, to attayn vnto the certain knowledge of what Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles taught. For what is more eaſy, then to hear a continued teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Paſtors &amp; people, who conſtantly depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that this is the doctrin, which they have receiued from their Forefathers? what can be more eaſy, then to open our eys and ſee the practiſe of all Chriſtians? No man of ſenſe will deny, if the true doctrin can be ſurely known hereby, but it is a much mor eaſy way, then by the Scriptures, which are ſo hard and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; or by any written word, although never ſo cleer. And it is alſo evident, that it is more vniverſal: for the Scriptures are only for thoſe, who can read, and vnderſtand them: but this ſerues for all ſortes of perſons: learned, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, theſe, who can read, or cannot, and even for the meaneſt capacities. This was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the meaning of God, when he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnder the Goſpel <hi>a direct way, ſo that fooles cannot erre by it.</hi> Therefore, this being ſo ſure,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 35.8.</note> ſo eaſy, ſo vniverſal a way, the wiſdom &amp; goodneſſe of God, who diſpoſeth all things wiſely and ſweetely, has made vſe of it. This may be yet further illuſtrated and confirmed,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:43743:178"/> by the manner how the Chriſtian religion was planted. Firſt the Apoſtles ſtayd long in one place, that they might diligently inculcate the Chriſtian doctrin, as S. Paul ſaid to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 20 27.31.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue not ſpared to declare vnto you all the Counſell of God &amp;c. For three years, night &amp; day, I ceaſed not with teares to warn every one,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, the Apoſtles earneſtly exhorted their diſciples, to keep carefully, what they had received:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.9.</note> to entruſt it vnto faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and not to admit any doctrin contrary to that, which they had received, not although an Angel from heauen should preach otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. Thirdly, The myſteries of the Chriſtian religion were not only ſenſibly taught to the eare; but they were rendred viſible to the ſight by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ractiſe &amp; devotion of the Chriſtian people. Fourthly, The Chriſtian religion was planted at once, in many diverſe nations.</p>
               <p>Therefore, it was eaſy for the primitive Chriſtians to know, what was the Apoſtles doctrin, which they had heard ſo often beaten into their eares, which they ſaw practiſed with their eys, and which was profeſt through out the whole word: and great reaſon had they not to receive any doctrin contrary to it. It was alſo eaſy for them to diſcern &amp; hold out all new &amp; falſe doctrins. For, although ſome would pretend never ſo much the Scriptures againſt the publique doctrin of the Church; yet the ancient Chriſtians knowing certainly, that the Scriptures are not contrary to the doctrin, which the Apoſtles had clearly delivered by
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:43743:178"/> lively voice, and publickly eſtablish'd in the Church: they vnderſtood the Scriptures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the clear rule of faith left by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. They did not, vpon pretext of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety between the doctrin of the Church &amp; the Scriptures, abandon the Apoſtles clear, lively doctrin, vniverſally eſtablisht; and follow a new gloſſe of their writings contrary to it; which had been indeed groſſe follie, and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly againſt the Apoſtles command in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as has been shown. And, as this was an eaſy way, in the firſt ages, to know the truth and to diſcern error; ſo it has been, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages. For the rule of faith ought to be immoveable, as the faith it ſelf is.</p>
               <p>God himſelf promiſeth the continuance of this eaſy way, when he ſaid by Eſay:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.21.</note> 
                  <hi>My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is in thee, and my words, which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, and out of the mouth of thy ſeed, for ever.</hi> And again. <hi>Vpon thy walls, ô Ieruſalem,</hi>

Auguſtin, <hi>there had been no General Councell aſſembled, in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: but the world was held in, by the ſtrength of Cuſtom, which was oppoſed to thoſe, who would bring in that novelty.</hi> S. Stephen Pope and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr wrote to S. Cyprian in theſe words: <hi>Nihil innovetur, niſi quod traditum eſt, Let nothing be changed, nothing received, but what has been delivered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herevpon, I propoſed this difficulty, that ſome things were believed, after the definition of a General Councel, which were not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before. Therefore, it would ſeem, that the Church has not always relied on that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to believe nothing, but what was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the conſtant teſtimony of their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat Anceſtors. To which the Catholique an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the clearing of this difficulty would manifeſt the ſtrength &amp; evidence of the former proof. Firſt, ſaid he, it is evident, that the principal, if not all the points maintain'd by Catholiques, and now queſtioned by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, did ever appear externally in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion &amp; practiſe of the whole Church, and were not defined by anterior Councils. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, according to S. Auguſtins rule, they are Apoſtolical.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>4.</hi> de baptiſ. c. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>For that,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which the vniverſal Church doth hold, and was not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Councels, but has been ſtill retayn'd in the Church, is moſt iuſtly believed to have deſcended from no other authority, than from the Apoſtles.</hi>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:43743:180"/> Therefore, this obiection makes nothing for the benefit of Proteſtants, who condemn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which were publickly &amp; vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally profeſt and practiſed in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were by any Councils authorized. Secondly, Theſe points of faith, which were determined by General Councels, were not defin'd as new doctrines. For either they were generally &amp; conſtantly believed by the whole Church, till ſome heretiques began violently to oppoſe them: or there were ſome points not ſo generally believed &amp; practiſed, throughout the whole Church: but ſome Catholiques did, with ſubmiſſion to the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church, doubt of them. Now, it is evident, that the Church, in the points of the firſt kind, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame thing, after the definition of a General Council, which she believed before; as we haue ſeen out of S. Athanaſius, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Divinity of Chriſt, which was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as well before the great Councell of Nice, as after it. Neither were theſe other points, of which ſome Catholiques doubted, defin'd as new doctrines: but the whole Church aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in a General Council, after due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, having found theſe points to have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, by ſufficient &amp; approued teſtimony, or tradition; and being aſſiſted by Chriſt, the head of his body, which is the Church, &amp; the holy Ghoſt, the Guide of it (according to our Sauiours promiſe, &amp; ſpecial neceſſary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over his Church) propoſeth them to be vniverſally believed, without any more doubt.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:43743:181"/> And whoſoever, after this definition of the vniverſal Church, &amp; of her ſupreme authority, call theſe things any more in queſtion, become heretiques, &amp; are caſt out of the Church. But all good Chriſtians, who had any doubt befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, for want of the Churches propoſeall, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now got that, do acquieſce, and are put out of all doubt: for to oppoſe the whole Church,<note place="margin">Aug. epiſt. <hi>118.</hi> ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

S. Auguſtin shewes how much himſelf relies on this iudgment, and that S.

                  <hi>in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, an error may be ſuffered.</hi> But, after the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Vniverſal Church, which is the higheſt authority on earth, has paſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned any error: then it is no more to be ſuffered: then theſe, who will not hear the Church, are, by our Sauiours command, to be eſteem'd as Heathens &amp; Publicans. By which, the difficulty propoſed is clearly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, &amp; the proof ſtands good: That the Church has alwayes believed that, which from father to ſon has been delivered; and amongſt all doctrines which have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, there is none deſcended more clearly, then the irrefragable teſtimony of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church: either as she is dilated through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, or as she is aſſembled in a General Council: whereof, the continual practice of the Church from the beginning, is a ſuperabvndant evidence.</p>
               <p>From this truth, we will briefly deduce ſome Corollaries. 1. Since we neither ought, nor can arrive vnto the certain knowledge of our Saviours and his Apoſtles doctrin; but by the teſtimony of the Catholique Church: this Teſtimony is not only neceſſary, for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the doctrines not written; but alſo of theſe, which are written: becauſe the true
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:43743:182"/> ſenſe of theſe cannot be infallibly known, but by this lively rule of faith. 2. The doctrines not written, which have been ſtill believed and profeſt in the Church, are truly Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal &amp; divine; as well as theſe doctrines, which are contain'd in Scripture: becauſe we have the ſame infallible aſſurance for them, that we have for theſe. 3. Since the Teſtimony and authority of the Vniverſal Church is the only means, by which we can be fully aſſured, what was the doctrin of Chriſt, and therefore is the formal motive of our belief: it followes, that, what ever the Church teſtifieth to be revealed by God, has been truly revealed, and ought to be beleeued; whither the matters themſelvs be great, or ſmall. And hereby, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants diſtinction of points fundamental &amp; not fundamental is quite overturned, and shewed to be impertinent. Becauſe neither of theſe points are beleeved for themſelv's, but for the divine authority, revealing them; and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known, but by the teſtimony of the Church, &amp; by her authority propoſing them. Therefor, the formal motive being the ſame for all points, they are all alike to be beleeved, when they are by the ſame authority of the Church ſufficiently propoſed: and in that caſe, to deny any thing, albeit never ſo ſmall for the matter, is a fundamental error, and clearly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the formal motive of our faith; for which all the points of faith are beleeved: and whoſoever diſbeleeves any thing at all ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, denies faith to God, &amp; reiects his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:43743:182"/> 4. He, who contemnes, or neglects the teſtimony of the Catholique Church, in the time, wherein he lives, (which is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony beyond all exception, &amp; moſt worthie of credit) can never come to the full &amp; certain knowledge of our Saviours doctrin. For that is, as it were, the firſt ſtep of the ladder, vpon which, if one ſet not firſt his foote, he cannot arrive vnto the top, that is vnto the firſt age, wherein Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles lived. 5. From this principle flow all the notes of the Church. As firſt her Vnity in all points of faith. For, if she has alway's beleeved nothing, but what was received from hand to hand, from father, to ſon, by the teſtimony of the Chriſtian world: and all perſons within her ſubmit to the ſame ſupreme authority of one chief Paſtor, &amp; of General Councels; the Church cannot but have Vnity in all points of faith. Secondly, the holyneſſe of the Church flowes alſo from the foreſaid principle. For, if the doctrin of the Church was holy at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (as all Chriſtians muſt confeſſe, and the doctrin by this continual teſtimony, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ever the ſame, as hath been proved) Then the Church is ſtill holy, in all her doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, which all tend to holyneſſe. Thirdly, the Church is alſo Catholique. For, it is by the teſtimony of Chriſtians in all Nations, that the doctrin of Chriſt is infallibly conueighed vnto vs. Laſtly, the Church is Apoſtolique. For it is by her continued teſtimony, that the doctrin of Chriſt is known in all generations; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:43743:183"/> she muſt have a continued ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to conclude; I hope; that I have proved now ſufficiently the Church in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Sea of Rome, by receiving all her doctrines in all ages, from her forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, has ever kept the ſame doctrin, which she firſt received from Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, &amp; never changed it: and therefore, as she was; ſo she ſtill is the ſpouſe of Chriſt, being a frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull Mother, &amp; yet a chaſt Virgin, never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from Chriſt: for she could never be drawn from the doctrin, which she once received from him, neither by the bloody perſecutions of the Pagans, nor by the deceitfull pretexts and allurements of heretiques: yea, she never did diſſemble the leaſt Error in her deereſt children,<note place="margin">Iude v. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> but, as S. Iude exhorts, has ever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> She has indeed been ever falſly accuſed, as an Adultereſſe, by all hereſies, which are themſelvs, as we have ſeen before, harlots and ſtrumpets: But she remaines pure &amp; chaſt. <hi>Adulterari non poteſt,</hi>

For, as the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Chriſt did appear, and the whole earth was filled with his praiſes; whereas his enemies, were cloathed with shame &amp; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were ſcattered through the earth, had their Temple deſtroyed, and their Nation rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So within a short time, the vnſpotted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency &amp; purity of his ſpouſe is manifeſted, to the shame &amp; confuſion of all hereſies; which being accurſed by the Church, with all their lies &amp; calumnies, are ever at length deſtroyed from the face of the earth: for, as the Wiſeman has obſerved,<note place="margin">Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic. c. <hi>3.</hi> v. <hi>11</hi>

It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſmall ſin in heretiques, that they do not only refuſe to hear the Church (for which crime alone, they are by Chriſts command to be holden, as Heathens &amp; Publicans) but alſo they falſly accuſe his Spouſe, which he loves ſo deerly, for an Adultereſſe, and charge her with Idolatry, Superſtition &amp; all ſorts of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. Theſe calumnies, if not blaſphemies, are the ground of all their new doctrines &amp;
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:43743:184"/> pretended Reformations: By which we may know the rare fabrick, which is erected vpon it.

Thererefore this cloud of the Miniſters calumnie, to witt: that the Catholique Church had changed the doctrin of Chriſt, &amp; brought in corruptions (which is the very ſame, which all heretiques have vſed, &amp; the new Arians vſe to this day) being diſpelled: I am confident, that by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, you ſee now the admirable light of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, and therefore, abandoning the darkneſſe of all error, will walk in this light, by which all the Saints have attain'd vnto

               <p>AS the great diſſenſions of our Miniſters furnished to me the firſt occaſions of my doubting, that their Church could not be the true Church; ſo the very light of Nature did shew me, that the true Church, being the work of God, muſt have Vnity. For what more belongs to the houſe of God, which ought to be a houſe of Order, then Vnity? what more fitting for his Kingdom, which muſt endure for ever, then Vnity, which tends to preſervation? what more vnbeſeeming them, then diſorder &amp; diviſion, which at length produces ruine &amp; deſtruction? The Scripture is full of clear teſtimonies to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as where it is ſaid of the Church, <hi>My Dove is one my beloved is one,</hi>

For elſe where he ſaith: <hi>There is one Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>one faith &amp; one baptiſm.</hi> But of theſe &amp; other paſſages of Scripture, which were brought, there was one, which had a ſpecial influence vpon me, and that was our
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:43743:185"/> Saviours prayer, in the 17. of S. Iohn: where, after he had prayed moſt earneſtly for the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Apoſtles, he prayes alſo for the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 17 20.</note> ſaying <hi>Neither pray I for thoſe alone, but for them alſo, who shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in me, through their word: That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be One, that the world may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> I did ſeriouſly ponder this reaſon, which our Saviour brings, to obtain his deſire, which was much vrged alſo by the Catholique: who shew me, that our Saviour declared thereby, the vnity of his Church should be ſo admirable, that the world should be moued thereby, to beleeve, that he was the Son of God, &amp; a true Prophet ſent from heaven, as ſome Fathers have alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. Therefore, it's evident by the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that the true Church muſt have Vnity,<note place="margin">Apud Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat in hunc locum.</note> and that that cannot be the true Church of Chriſt, which wants it. And, if we shall ſpeak of the holy Fathers, they are ſo much for this Vnity of the Church; that ſome of them have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten whole Treatiſes concerning it.</p>
               <p>Now it is no leſſe evident both to ſenſe and reaſon, that this Vnity agrees better to the Church in Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Sea of Rome, then to the Proteſtant Churches; or rather, it agrees fully to the one, and not at all to the other. For who may not ſee, by the manifold Schiſmes &amp; Diviſions, which are now among Proteſtants &amp; all other Sectaries; as well in Doctrine, as Government, (which we have
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:43743:186"/> touched above, and which do dayly augment) that the Proteſtant Churches have no Vnity? Shortly after Luthers riſing, the Proteſtant Church was divided into three principal ſects, to witt: the Lutherans, Calviniſts &amp; Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians; that we may ſpeak nothing of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and Libertins. But now their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have ſo multiplyed, that they can hardly be numbred. And theſe diviſions are not only great, for the matter, being in ſome principal points of doctrin; but alſo have been very great for the manner. For thereby diverſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have kild and deſtroy'd one another, made bloody warres, and overturned kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me &amp; Commonwealths. So that, if there were no other Chriſtian Church, but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; the world could not be moved, by the Vnity thereof, to beleeve that Chriſt was ſent from heaven, or had been a divine Architect, who had built ſuch a Babel of Confuſion.</p>
               <p>But, if laying aſide rancour &amp; preiudice we will caſt our eyes vpon the Church in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the ſea of Rome: this Vnity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears wonderfully in her. For how can it be but wonderfull, to conſider, that this Church, being dilated throughout the world, in ſo many diverſe, &amp; remote Kingdomes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces &amp; Countreys, of different languages, Cuſtoms &amp; worldly intereſts; and ſome of theſe being enemies to others, in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, should all agree in the Vnity of the ſame Catholique faith, as if they were one man: Whereas all other Churches, which go out
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:43743:186"/> from this, vnder pretext of greater purity (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do not fill the earth, but are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in ſmall bounds) fall into ſuch horrible diſſenſions and diviſions, that they never reſt, till, like generations of vipers, they deſtroy one an other, and oftentimes the later deſtroies the former, as we have ſeen in our time? The Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome may be known to be the true Church, by this admirable Vnity, for which Chriſt prayed; and Chriſt by it may be known, to have been ſent from heaven, who had eſtablish't vpon earth ſo large a Kingdome of ſuch admirable Vnity. If the Vnity of the Catholique Church were not a ſpecial bliſſing of God, how could it fall out to her alone? How could it have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long, among ſuch great multitudes of people, as have been, and are of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? How comes it to paſſe, that Vnity could never be conſerved among heretiques, who, although but few, and new, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shun the curſe of Diviſion; which ever deſtruction followes at the heels? For my part, I cannot reſiſt vnto this clear reaſon.</p>
               <p>As this Vnity in the Catholique Church proceeds principally, from the bliſſing of God; ſo ſecondarly it flowes from the ordinary means, which his divine wiſdome has appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and whereof all falſe Churches are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. As firſt from this principle, that she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves nothing, but what has deſcended vnto her, by the conſtant teſtimony of her forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in all ages, from the time of Chriſt &amp; his
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:43743:187"/> Apoſtles. By which means, it has been shown, that she cannot but keep Vnity in faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, She receives the Decrees of all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, which, in all reaſon, ought to be believed, to preſerve that, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Apoſtles: and, if any doubt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, about the ſenſe of the Scriptures, are more able to interpret them, then any other perſons. To which therefore, all the members of the Catholique Church do modeſtly &amp; wiſey ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their iudgments: they never ranſack any matter of faith once defined; but it remaines ever inviolable. And laſtly, All Catholiques ſubmit themſelves to one Supreme Paſtor, whom they acknowledge to be eſtablish't by Chriſt over the whole Church: From whom, the holy Fathers do affirm, that the Vnity of the Church doth much depend. This perſon appoynted by Chriſt, they shew out of the Scriptures, to have been S. Peter, to whom Chriſt ſaid:<note place="margin">Math. <hi>16.19.</hi> Iohn <hi>21 16.18.</hi> Cypr. in tract. de ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator.</note> I will give thee the keys of the Kingdome of Heaven &amp;c. and again; Feed my sheep, feed my Lambs. Vpon which S. Cyprian ſaith: <hi>That Chriſt might shew Vnity, he eſtablish't one Chaire; and he diſpoſed, by his authority, the Origin of that Vnity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from One,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Primacy is given to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that one Church of Chriſt and one Chaire might be shown.</hi> S.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:43743:187"/> S. Peter, in that ſame Dignity &amp; Primacy, and that the Vnity of the Church depends vpon his authority, all the holy Fathers do affirm. The ſame S. Hierom, writing to S. Damaſus Bishop of Rome, ſaith:<note place="margin">Hier ep. ad Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſum.</note> 
                  <hi>With the Succeſſor of the Fisher, &amp; with the Diſciple of the Croſſe I ſpeak &amp;c.

                  </note> S. Auguſtin tearmeth the ſea of their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>the Chair of Vnity,</hi> and S. Cyprian calls it <hi>the beginning of Vnity,</hi> &amp; the <hi>roote of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As, by theſe means, the Vnity of the true Church is preſerved; ſo, for want of them, there can be no conſtant Vnity in falſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For they all, reiecting the infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony &amp; authority of the Catholique Church, by which we are certified of our Saviours doctrine, as has been shewed, put their own election and private iudgment in place of it: and their iudgments being diverſe, they make diverſe faiths, having no Compaſſe to ſteer by, but the Scriptures, which they diverſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, according to their pleaſures. Neither do
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:43743:188"/> they ſubmit themſelv's to the ſentence of any Church, for they beleeve, that all Churches may erre: neither is their own Church conſtant in her ſentence; for one Aſſembly ranſacks and condemns, as hereſy and Anti-Chriſtian, what another has defined &amp; approved, as Chriſtian truths. Neither have they any ſupreme Paſtor, to whom they obey. And, in a word, they have no bond to ty them together, except ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes worldly intereſt, or the hatred of another religion. And, when theſe intereſts faile, when by mutual aſſiſtance &amp; ioyn't forces, they have ſubdued or overturned that Church, which they eſteem their Common adverſarie: then they inſtantly begin, to be miſerably ſcattered &amp; divided; as fresh experience sheweth, how after the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the late English Church, the brethren of Scotland and England became hugely divided, notwithſtanding the ſolemne League &amp; Covenant which had before ſo ſtraitly tyed them together. Yea, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the wit of man, to make it otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. For, beſides that it is impoſſible, that many men can a long time adhere to the ſame fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods (as we ſuppoſe all hereſies to be) the nature of man being ſo ſtrongly bent vpon truth, this confuſion &amp; diviſion followes from the nature of their principal doctrin, which is the ground work of all the reſt, to witt: that every one should have liberty, of reading &amp; interpreting Scripture, and iudging the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers doctrin thereby. From which ground, there muſt needs ariſe variety of ſects in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, according to the various conceipts and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:43743:188"/> apprehenſions of people. Moreover, God, in his iuſt iudgment, ſends ever the curſe of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among heretiques; for, according to their ſin, ſo are they punished. They endeavoured to divide the Church, and themſelvs are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſo at length deſtroied. This God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the Prophet Eſay, when he ſaid;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 19.2.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſet the Aegyptians againſt the Aegyptians, and they shall fight every one againſt his brother, and every one againſt his neighbour: citie againſt citie, and Kingdome againſt Kingdome.</hi> S. Auguſtin ſaith: <hi>it is the iuſt iudgment of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug lib. de agone Chriſti c <hi>29.</hi> &amp; lib <hi>1.</hi> de bapt. c <hi>6.</hi>

                  <hi>that thoſe, who ſeek nothing elſe, but to divide the Church, should themſelves be miſerably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</hi> And ſo he shewes, how the Donatiſts were <hi>cut into ſmall threds.</hi> S. Chryſoſtom affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that the ſin of dividing the Church is ſo great, that nothing doth ſo provoke the anger of God. So that, when we have done all other manner of good,<note place="margin">Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt. hom <hi>11.</hi> in ep. ad Epheſ.</note> we deſerve no leſſe ſevere punishment, for dividing the Vnity &amp; fulneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of the Church, then thoſe, who pierced &amp; divided Chriſts own body. Salomon ſaith: that there are <hi>ſix things, which our Lord hates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proverb</hi> 6.16.19</note> 
                  <hi>and the ſeventh is abomination to him;</hi> which is, <hi>He who ſoweth diſcord among brethren.</hi> How much then muſt he hate and abhorre thoſe, who ſow diſcord in his Church, which is his body, and his ſpouſe, for which he died, and for the Vnity whereof he ſo ardently prayed? And therefore it's no wonder, to ſee the curſe of diviſion fall ever among them. And, as this diviſion and contrariety ariſeth naturally from
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:43743:189"/> their principall doctrin, &amp; the ground of all the reſt, beſides Gods iudgment on them; ſo they have no way to take it away when it doth ariſe. For albeit they pretend the word of God to be their Iugde of Controverſies, to which they promiſe all obedience; yet this Iudge could never hitherto end any controverſy among them: and indeed it is not the <hi>word,</hi> but the <hi>ſword,</hi> which decides all their Controverſies. The iuſt contrary is in the Catholique Church. For, albeit all hereſies and ſects do firſt ariſe out from her,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>There muſt be hereſies,</hi> and S. Iohn affirmeth, <hi>They went out from vs but were not of vs:</hi> yet, they do not ariſe from the nature of the Churches doctrin, or from her principles, which are conſtant &amp; immoveable, all tending to Vnity; but from the malice of the Devil. And, when they ariſe, the Church loſeth not her Vnity thereby. For, if theſe coyners, or followers of new doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, do not ſubmit themſelvs to the iudgment of the Church; they are iudicially cutt off from that body; from which they firſt cut themſelvs by miſbeleef; and by this means, the reſt of the body, is preſerved entire, and at Vnity within it ſelf. So that, when any queſtion ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, the Church has a ſolid way to take away all Controverſie, and to preſerve Vnity. But the Proteſtants principles tend to diviſion, and they have no means to take it away, as has been shewed.</p>
               <p>Since then, it is ſo evident by the Scripture, that the Church of Chriſt muſt have Vnity; it
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:43743:189"/> is no leſſe evident, that that cannot be the true Church, which wants Vnity, and is full of Diſſenſions &amp; Diviſions: as the Proteſtant Church appeares now evidently to be, even to the weakeſt vnderſtandings, by her great Schiſmes and diviſions, both in doctrin &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And therefore he, who believes a Church of ſo great diviſion or confuſion, to be the true Church, cannot be ſaid to follow the Scriptures; but rather to controul them, and to follow his own fancies. Whereas the Church in Communion with the Sea of Rome, by her admirable Vnity, both in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin &amp; diſciplin, all the world over, even to the leaſt article or point of faith, may be eaſily ſeen to be the true Church of Chriſt, which was founded by him; and he, by the ſame Vnity, may be known to be the true Meſſias, who was ſent from heaven.</p>

Therefore that Church, which teacheth impious doctrin, and wherein there is little, or no holyneſſe of life, cannot be the true Church. Let vs then briefly ſee to which Church; whither to the Proteſtant, or to the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome, this mark of Holyneſſe doth beſt agree</p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning doctrin, I find that the firſt Apoſtles of Proteſtants teach doctrin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly repugnant to the goodneſſe of God, to the Nature of man, to the holyneſſe of the Chriſtian Sacraments, &amp; to the obſervation of Gods commandments, beſides many other particulars. Calvin, the great Foundatour of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:43743:190"/> Presſbytery, teaches, that God is the Author of ſin: for thus he writeth.<note place="margin">Cal lib. <hi>1.</hi> inſtit. cap. <hi>18</hi> par. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Now I have clearly enough shewed, that God is called the Author of all theſe things, which theſe Controwlers</hi> (to witt the Papiſts) <hi>will have to fall forth, by his idle permiſſion onely.</hi> And ſuch things, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Catholiques, God willeth not, but only permits, are ſins; of which Calvin there ſpeaks, as of the blindneſſe and tyranny of Achab: of the inceſt of Abſalon, and the like: of which he calls God the Author. Again he ſaith: <hi>Man, by the iuſt impulſion of God,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>doth that, which is not lawfull for him to do.</hi> And of Pharao, he ſaith: <hi>Deus voluit vtique illum iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſui ſuo non obtemperare, immo vt ei repugnaret,</hi>

                  <hi>ipſe in eo effecit. God willed him not to obey his Commandment, yea he himſelf wrought that in him, that he might diſobey it.</hi> Many more places are collected by Becan, in a Treatiſe, which he wrote on this ſubiect <hi>de Authore peccati.</hi> Where he cites diverſe teſtimonies of Beza and other Proteſtant Authors, to the ſame purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. Now, that this is an impious opinion, and againſt the very clear light of nature, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For all men conceive by natural inſtinct, that God is not only good in himſelf, but alſo goodneſſe it ſelf, the Author and fountain of all goodneſſe. But how can he be goodneſſe itſelf, and the Author of goodneſſe, if he be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of wickedneſſe? A holy Father ſaith:<note place="margin">Baſil. quod Deus noe ſit auctor malor.</note> 
                  <hi>It's the ſame madneſſe to deny God, and to ſay he is the Author of ſin.</hi> For, if he be the Author of ſin, he is not good: if he be not good, he is not
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43743:191"/> God. The Manicheans taught the ſame impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but with this difference, that they made not the good, but the evil God the Author of evil. Moreover, it's evident, that God cannot be the Author of that, whereof he is the punisher. But he is the punisher of ſin. Therefore he cannot be the Author of it. I know ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſtrive to make a faire face, vpon this doctrin of Calvin, but all in vain; for it is ſo black and vgly of it ſelf, in the tearmes which he vſeth, that, as it is in the proverb, theſe, who would blanch it, vndertake to wash a black-Moore. The text is ſo bad, that it can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no good Commentarie.<note place="margin">Feuar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius lib. <hi>2.</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machiae Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſticae cap. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> So that the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans in Germanie have condemned it, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious againſt God, &amp; pernicious to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: and the Zuinglians of <hi>Berne</hi> cauſed Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins books, wherein theſe black errors were contain'd, to be burnt publickly, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Executioner. He teacheth alſo ſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin no leſſe pernicious, in the iudgment of many, concerning predeſtination: as that God by his only will has ordaind many, without any conſideration of their merits, to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Cal. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Inſt. c. <hi>22.</hi> par. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> His words are theſe? <hi>By his only will, and without any conſideration of their merits, they are predeſtinated to eternal death.</hi> Such doctrin wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich transformes God into the Devil, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him as the greateſt Tyrant imaginable, cannot be holy, no more then he, who taught it, can be heavenly: albeit he be much eſteem'd by the Preſbyterians, who keep ſtill this doctrin lying at their hearts, though, vpon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:43743:191"/> they are ashamd to profeſſ it.</p>
               <p>Secondly. As he robs God of his goodneſſe, ſo doth he alſo ſpoile man of his free-will: which is not only falſe, againſt common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the confeſſion of mankind: for as S. Auguſtin ſaith: <hi>no fewneſſe of the learned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. lib. de vera relig. c. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>no company of the vnlearned do deny it:</hi> but alſo in the iudgment of many Proteſtants, it makes all exhortations, admonitions and threats, which are ſo frequent in the Scriptures, both vſeleſſe and ridiculous; it hinders all exerciſe, yea, and attempt of vertue &amp; holyneſſe; and, with the opinion of Gods abſolute decree of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it brings men to deſpaire. Thirdly, their doctrin of the impoſſibility to keep the divine commandments, even with the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, we have ſeen above to be iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the goodneſſe, wiſdom, and iuſtice of God; to be a great hindrance of the growth of piety, and of the care of a good life; from wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich wicked doctrin, flowed the impious ſect of the Anti-Nomians. To which, if we shall add that doctrin, which they call the life of their religion, to witt, their iuſtification by a ſpecial faith only, whereby they beleeve, that all their ſins are forgiven them: what a wid gate is opened to all licentious liberty, to the neglect of piety and of all good works? Their doctrin alſo concerning the Sacraments is not holy, which robs them of all grace, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſanctification. In a word, if the proper doctrines of the Preſbyterians be impartially conſidered: there is almoſt nothing amongſt
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43743:192"/> them, which hath appearance of holyneſſe, or any invitation to it. For they do not eſteem their Churches holy, they have no holy orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no holy Veſſels, no holy rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, no holy dayes or feſtivities, no holy forme of publique worship, or ſervice of God; and nothing, that ſetteth forth the Maieſty &amp; magnificence of God, or that can breed reſpect or revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in man. Yea, their principles, if they be followed, lead to prophaneſſe or Atheiſm: whereof I will bring ſome few inſtances. The firſt is of one named <hi>Godefridus a Valle,</hi> who wrote a book,<note place="margin">Becan. opuſc. diſp. An Deus ſit Auctor. peccati cap. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> which he entitled, <hi>Of the art of beleeving nothing:</hi> In which he ſaid, all other things falſe, and one only thing true: as Becan relates, to witt: that he, who would become an Atheiſt, should firſt be a Calviniſt, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been. For, from that doctrin of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, that God is the Author of ſin, and that, by his abſolute decree of Reprobation, he had preordain'd the moſt part of men vnto damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any regard of their works, but only for his own pleaſure, he collected, that ſuch a God was a moſt cruel Tyrant. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he would rather deny there was a God, then acknowledge ſuch a God. And therevpon he became a profeſt Atheiſt, and was burnt publickly in Paris, in the yeare 1572. Another inſtance fell out, not long ago, in our own Countrey on another ſubiect. For, as the Preſbyterian Miniſters generally teach, that the Church is no more holy, then any other place; nor no more reverence due vnto it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:43743:192"/> only, when the Miniſter is preaching: ſo a great Apoſtle of the Covenant taught that doctrin very eagerly, in Aberdeen: the fruite whereof did shortly thereafter appear. For a covenanting ſouldier of the Saints army, was found, within few dayes, in the Colledge Church of that town, in vncivil converſation with a woman, and being brought before the ſame Miniſter, (as I was credibly informed) who did exaggerate the grievouſneſſe of the crime, from the holyneſſe of the place; he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered; that there was neither preaching nor praying in the Church, at that time By which he confounded the Miniſter. Now of a long time, they keep their Churches shut both night and day, except only at ſuch times, as the Miniſter is to preach. I knew alſo a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who took great ſcandal at a Miniſters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, wherein he vndertook to prove, againſt the Papiſts, the impoſſibility of living chaſtly: which doctrin she truly ſaid was very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to young people, and looſed the reines to all laſciviouſneſſe. So that in many points both concerning God and man, the Sacraments &amp; the Commandments, we ſee the Preſbyterian Church is not holy in doctrin.</p>
               <p>But, on the other part, the Church in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Sea of Rome teacheth moſt holy doctrin, in all theſe points. For firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, she teacheth that in him there are all perfections, in an infinit degree: that he is not only good in himſelf, but the fountain of all goodneſſe, and that no evil can proceed
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:43743:193"/> from him. That he is neither the cauſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or approver of ſin. That he is ſo good, that he would not permit ſin to be, vnleſſe he could draw good from it. That he has prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate no man to damnation, but only for ſins, which they willingly &amp; freely commit. This is the doctrin of the Catholique Church, and of the holy Fathers.<note place="margin">Aug. in Enchir. c. <hi>100.</hi>

                  <hi>nothing filthie and wicked is propoſed to be ſeen or followed.

And, in a word, this Church Militant here on earth is a true repreſentation of the Church Triumphant in heaven, ſtill adoring, praiſing and magnifying God. Therefore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe of doctrin belongs rather to this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, than to the Proteſtant.</p>
               <p>Then, for holyneſſe of life. I never knew any Iudicious Proteſtant, but acknowledged that the Catholiques had too much the better of them. Luther the firſt Apoſtle profeſſeth, that whilſt he lived, among the religious of S.

But after his fall from the Catholique Church, he changed not only miſerably his faith, but alſo his life. For thus he proclaimes his own shame.<note place="margin">Luth. tom. <hi>5.</hi> wit. ſer. de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim. f. <hi>119.</hi> Et tom. <hi>1.</hi> epiſ. fol. <hi>334.</hi> Zuingl. tom. <hi>2.</hi> in reſp. ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſ.

And, to make himſelf more infamous, he, having vowed his chaſtity to God, married a profeſt Nun, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Katherin Bore,</hi> who had made the like vow. He is charged alſo by his fellow Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, with arrogancy, inſolency &amp; intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pride, which he exerciſed againſt perſons of greateſt quality; as againſt the Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, King of England. His bitter railings, his fowle and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:43743:194"/> filthy expreſſions have bred ſuch a ſtench in all his writings, that they purchaſed to him the Title of <hi>Propheta Stercorarius,</hi> or the <hi>Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill Prophet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Shlus. in Theo. Calvin lib. <hi>2.</hi> fol. <hi>72.</hi>
                  </note> Theſe qualities are very far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from Saints vertues. Concerning <hi>Calvin,</hi> it is affirmed by <hi>Conradus shluſſelburg,</hi> a famous Lutheran, that he was guilty of Sodomie, and other abominable vices, for which he was branded on the shoulder, by the Magiſtrate of <hi>Noyon</hi> with a hote iron. That he was ſtriken, alſo a little before his death, by the hand of God, with Herods deſeaſe, and that he dyed in deſpaire, curſing and blaſpheming. No leſſe vices alſo are layd to Beza his charge, who did celebrate his own shame and filthy luſts, with moſt laſcivious Epigrammes. All which are not alleadgeances of Catholiques, but teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Proteſtants, againſt themſelvs. Neither are theſe Reformers commonly, even by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, eſteemd Saints. As for the common multitude, which followed the Reformers, Luther himſelf confeſſeth, that the world is become <hi>ſeven times worſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luth. in postill ſup. Euang. Domin pae Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus.</note> then it was before, in the Papacy: yea it is generally obſerved, that Catholiques, who become Proteſtants, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge their life into worſe. And, albeit the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, during the late troubles, did vſurp to themſelvs very ridiculouſly, the name of Saints; yet, both in the iudgment of other Proteſtants, and in the truth of the matter, they were very far from deſerving that title. For, if we will beleeve the old Proteſtants, avarice, pride, tyranny, cruelty, impudent railing, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:43743:194"/> periurie, and many ſuch other vices are the Preſbyterians greateſt vertues: and, who are moſt exorbitant in theſe enormities, are their greateſt Saints; as they inſtance in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me chief Apoſtles of the Covenant, in whom they affirm theſe vices to be palpably evident. Neither have the Preſbyterians any better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the old Proteſtants, whom they call <hi>Malignants,</hi> as appear'd by their Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, thundered out againſt the Bishops, at the Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> for very horrible cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. And, albeit the Bishops, at leaſt ſome of them, were not guilty of theſe crimes; yet the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re was no wiſe man even amongſt thoſe, who loved them moſt, that thought any of them a Saint, or eminent for holyneſſe. Neither can the Preſbyterians be Saints, even in their own principles, vnleſſe they would make their lives not only better then their belief, but alſo contrary to it. For they, teaching that the Commandments are impoſſible to be kept, even with Gods grace; how can they pretend to keep them? And, if they keep them not, how can they pretend to be Saints? Theſe are poore Saints, who break every day Gods Commandments; and much more, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a mortal ſin in all their actions: as the Preſbyterians commonly teach. Their actions alſo, which need not to be here recounted, and ought to be better beleeved, than their words, shew, that they were not Saints. A late Author, who had occaſion to know well both ſorts of Proteſtants, gives this verdict of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:43743:195"/> them.<note place="margin">Loſt sheep p. <hi>192.</hi>

Neither did God ever teſtify, either the holyneſſe of any of their lives, or of their doctrin, by any miracle.</p>

In this indeed, the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians go beyond the Manicheans. S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin proceeds to the praiſe of the holyneſſe of the Clergy, the Bishops, Prieſts &amp; Deacons,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:43743:196"/> whoſe vertue, he ſaith, is ſo much the more wonderfull, how much it's more hard to keep it, in ſuch a kind of troubleſome life, amongſt ſo great a multitude of perſons, with whom, for their ſpiritual goods they do converſe. And yet he ſaith: that he knew many holy perſons in all theſe vocations, as alſo many of the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of all ranks &amp; qualities, living holyly in the world, as if they did not vſe the world, and who would willingly forſake all wordly things, before they forſook the love and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of God. This Deſcription of the ancient Catholique Church, which the Catholique shew vnto me, did repreſent very clearly to my ſight how fitly the preſent Catholique Church doth agree with it, in all theſe holy orders and Inſtitutions: and it did no leſſe evidently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto me, how monſtruouſly the preſent Proteſtant Church is different from it. Laſtly, diverſe hiſtories, as well of Enemies, as of friends, have recorded many famous miracles, wrought in the Catholique Church, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of her doctrin, and for manifeſtation of the holyneſſe of ſome perſons, who have lived &amp; dyed, in her Communion.

               <p>We need not make great ſearch, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:43743:198"/> For, if we will ſpeak of the time, before Luther, the Church in Communion with the Sea of Rome, was ſo much Catholique, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Proteſtants; that there was no little company, yea nor one perſon at all, of the Proteſtant religion, to be ſeen or found, to conteſt with her, for this glorious title of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique.</hi> Whereas, from Luther vpward, in every generation, she may be proved, by the moſt famous teſtimonies, hiſtories, records &amp; Monuments in the world, to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Catholique, that is, to have been a moſt ample Society, keeping the Communion of Nations, and to have been moſt eminent, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve all other religions, ſects and hereſies, that went out from her; which being condemned by this Church, were, as vnprofitable boughs, cut off from the vine; and ſo remaining, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they fell, in petty corners of the world, did ſoone wither and decay. Again, if we will make now the compariſon between the Church in Communion with the Roman ſea, and the Proteſtants Churches ſince Luther aroſe: we shall find the laſt come very short of the other, for Vniverſality: and that for the ſame very reaſon, which S.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Theſe ſects,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are not found in many Nations, where this</hi> (to witt, the Catholique Church) <hi>is: and this, which is every where, is found alſo even where theſe ſects are.</hi> So it may be ſaid, Proteſtants are not to be found in many Nations, where the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion is profeſt, and Catholiques may
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:43743:198"/> be found, where ever Proteſtants are. For all the diverſe ſorts of Proteſtants are comprized, within Europe, and poſſeſſe only the Northern parts thereof, there being ſome moſt famous &amp; large kingdomes &amp; provinces, even within Europe, where they are not to be ſeen, or found, as in all <hi>Spaine, Italy, Sicily:</hi> and in others, they are but ſcantly ſowen, as in <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, Poland, Germanie,</hi> where they are not a handfull to the Catholiques. And in theſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thern places, which they poſſeſſe, out of which they banished by force the publick exercice of the Catholique religion, and ſtill perſecute the profeſſors of it, there are not deficient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, who in the midſt of the enemies of their religion, have alway's profeſt their faith. But in other parts of the world, where the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion doth wonderfully flourish, the name of Proteſtants is not ſo much as known. For the Catholique religion is not only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly profeſſed, in the moſt famous Kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and Provinces of Europe, but alſo it is to be found in <hi>Africk, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> And, albeit in diverſe Countries, the publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion be Heretical, Mahometical, or Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nih; yet, even there, the Catholique Roman Church hath Fathers and children, profeſſing her faith: and, what she loſt by the falling away of Proteſtants in <hi>Europe,</hi> she has gained with much encreaſe, by the propagation of the Catholique faith, in the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> &amp; now of late in the great Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> where many thowſands have e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braced the faith.</p>

               <p>If then the Society of Chriſtians in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Roman Church remaines ſtill Catholique, notwithſtanding that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have falne away from her, and albeit they would muſter together all their forces againſt her: how much more is she Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in regard of Proteſtants, if they be taken a part by their diverſe ſects &amp; ſcattered troops, as in all reaſon they ought to be? For none should be eſteem'd of one religion, but theſe, who are of one Communion; and therefore, ſince Vniverſality doth neceſſarly include Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no Proteſtant Church can be further Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, then her Communion is ſpread, which will be found to be ſo little a way, that every one of thoſe Proteſtant Churches, eſpecially being compared with the Roman Catholique, will deſerve rather the title of particular, then of Vniverſal.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the holy Fathers have obſerved, that as the Church in Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſea of Rome has ever had the thing ſignifyed by the word Catholique: ſo she alone has ever poſſeſſed the glorious title of Catholique, whereof heretiques have been very ambitious; but could never obtain it. S. Auguſtin did eſteem the title of Catholique ſo plain an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the true Church,<note place="margin">Aug. cont. epiſt. fund. c. <hi>4.</hi>

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:43743:199"/> enquires any of them, where the Catholiques do aſſemble, no heretique is ſo bold as to shew him his own</hi> meeting place. Again he ſaith:<note place="margin">Idem lib. de vera re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. c. <hi>6.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This name of Catholique the true Church received from the Apoſtles, to make her be known from all hereticall Congregations: which she has ever caried as a badge of truth, &amp; a title of great honour. S. Cyril, expounding the Apoſtles Creed, ſaith:<note place="margin">Cyril. Hieroſol. Catech. <hi>15.</hi>

                  <hi>For this end thy faith has given to thee this article, the holy Catholique Church, that thou mayſt avoid the polluted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles of heretiques.</hi> And a little after: <hi>When thou commeſt into a Town, enquire not ſimply where the Temple of our Lord is, for heretiques alſo call their dens, Temples. Neither ask ſimply, where the Church is; but ask, where is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church: For that is the</hi> proper Name <hi>of this holy Church.</hi> Vpon the other part: as no hereſies could ever be Vniverſal, for time or place, (for he, who has preſcribed bounds to the Sea, has alſo ordain'd that no hereſie can cover the earth) ſo by the divine Providence they could never obtain the title of <hi>Catholique</hi> but were ever denominated from their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: as <hi>Arians, Pelagians, Lutherans, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts;</hi> or from ſome accident; <hi>as Proteſtants,</hi> for proteſting againſt the Emperours Edicts:<note place="margin">Hierom. cont.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:43743:200"/> probability, call themſelvs Catholiques. For what would be more ridiculous; then, if the <hi>Independents,</hi> or <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are of ſo late ſtanding, and of ſo litle extenſion, would ſtile themſelvs Catholiques: this word ſignifying Vniverſality, both of time &amp; place, which they evidently want? The ſame may be as iuſtly ſaid of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or of any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Congregation. And, if any of theſe ſects were ſo vnwiſe as to call themſelvs ſo, they would not be vnderſtood, but taken for Papiſts.</p>
               <p>I remember, that my Catholique friend shew me, that it has been an ordinary cuſtom of thoſe, who ſeparat themſelv's from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church; when they ſee, that they neither have the thing ſignifyed by the word <hi>Catholique;</hi> nor can obtain the title of it, to shew themſelvs enemies to both. This the old Donatiſts did, who pretended that it was not neceſſary,<note place="margin">Aug. cont. Creſcon. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>66.</hi>
                  </note> the true Church should have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Nations or be Vniverſal; that truth is often among a few, and that it was the fault of many to erre. This ſame ſome Proteſtants do pretend. Againſt which may be oppoſed the words of S. Auguſtin,<note place="margin">Aug. epiſt. <hi>48</hi>
                  </note> who ſaith: <hi>As he shall be Anathema or accurſed, who preacheth, that neither Chriſt ſuffered, nor roſe again; becauſe we learned by the Goſpel, that it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer and to riſe again the third day: ſo he shall alſo be anathema, whoſoever preacheth the Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch to be elſwhere, then in the Communion of all Nations: becauſe, by the ſelf ſame Goſpel,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:43743:200"/> we learn in the words next following, pennance to be preached in his name, and remiſſion of ſins, throughout all Nations.</hi> Then, for the word <hi>Catholique,</hi> Luther was ſo great an enemy to it, that he tooke it out of the Apoſtles Creed, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the word <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in place of it.

S. Auguſtin relates, how the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts alſo were great Enemies to the word <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique,</hi> calling it <hi>a humane forgerie, or fiction,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To conclude therefore this point. As it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both by the Creed, and by the Scripture that the true Church muſt be Catholique; ſo it's very clear &amp; certain, that the Proteſtant Church, before Luther, was not Catholique; that as yet, it is not Catholique, and, by all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:43743:201"/> never will be. For, according to the nature of hereſie, it gote all what it poſſeſſeth, at the firſt hurle; and theſe 80. years, it hath made no progreſſe, but rather by its own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions hath gone backward, and has been ſtill on the looſing hand. Therefore, the Proteſtant Church, not being Catholique, cannot be the true Church. Vpon the other part, it is no leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe evident, that, of all Chriſtian ſocieties, the Church in Communion with the ſea of Rome was the Catholique Church, in the time of the Apoſtles, as it was alſo, in the time of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin and of the holy Fathers; and ever ſince, it has had the Communion of Nations, kept all General Councels, made decrees, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all Errors &amp; hereſies: And, in a word, what the holy Scriptures have ſo clearly fore-tould of the Vniverſality of Chriſts Church, and of the converſion of Gentils from infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Chriſtianity, hath been accomplished in this Church alone, and performed by her members. Therefore, this Church, and no other, is the holy Catholique and true Church of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>BY this note or property of <hi>Apoſtolique,</hi> the holy Fathers and auncient Councels would have the true Church clearly known and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, from all new ſects &amp; hereſies. The Church is called Apoſtolique, principally for two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it was founded by the Apoſtles, and from their time muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue vnto the end of the world. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Paſtors thereof derive their Miſſion from the Apoſtles, by ordinary calling &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſucceſſion. In the firſt ſenſe, the true Church is clearly diſtinguished, from all ſects and falſe Churches: becauſe they were not founded by the Apoſtles, but by ſome new pretended Reformers, who aroſe after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in their ſeveral generations; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, theſe new Churches, founded and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by them, are not called Apoſtolique; but have their denomination, from their founders: ſuch as the <hi>Arians, Pelagians, Lutherans, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts.</hi> In the ſecond ſenſe, she is alſo clearly diſtinguished from falſe Churches: becauſe they have not lawful Paſtors, deriving their
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:43743:202"/> vocation from the Apoſtles, by a continued and vninterrupted ſucceſſion; but intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs into the office of Paſtors, without any lawfull calling. Of the firſt ſenſe of the word <hi>Apoſtolique,</hi> we have ſpoken ſufficiently above, when we proved the true Church, by her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity and continued ſucceſſion; and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all falſe Churches, for want of it; which proofes need not to be here repeated. Of the ſecond ſenſe of the word <hi>Apoſtolique,</hi> we shall here briefly ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Beſids the authority of the Creed, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Scriptures, that there muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Paſtors in the Church, lawfully called to that charge. God ſaith by the Prophet Eſay: <hi>vpon thy walls,</hi>

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:43743:203"/> &amp; ſenſible way, for all men, to diſcern, between true &amp; falſe Paſtors; that they may be preſerved from error, in ſo great danger: or elſe, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now, the ſame Scripture points out this ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and direct way, if men would walk in it. For it shewes, that all true Paſtors muſt have ſenſible vocation &amp; Miſſion; and theſe, who want them, cannot be true and Lawful Paſtors Firſt it's evident, that our Saviour did ſenſibly call 12. Apoſtles, and ſent them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to feed &amp; govern his Church. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Apoſtles did alſo ſenſibly call and ordain other Paſtors, as is evident, in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; ordination of S. Mathias. Thirdly, the chief Paſtors, that is Bishops, received al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo power from the Apoſtles, to chooſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain others, as is evident, in what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture records of Titus and Timothee. This was ſo evident and ſenſible a way, that fooles might not erre in it. And, if this order was always obſerved, that none could be eſteem'd lawful Paſtors, but who were thus called and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd by others, who had received that power: then it was as eaſy to know a true Paſtor, from a falſe Apoſtle; as it is eaſy to know, who is called to be a Iudge, in the State, from an vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for they are both diſcernable, by eaſy and ſenſible ſigns. This is the doore, of which our Saviour ſpeaks; by which all theſe, who are lawfull Paſtors, enter into the government of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:43743:203"/> the Church; and all theſe, who enter not by this doore, and yet vſurp that honour to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, are theevs, who climb vp another way, and ſo may be eaſily known. The auncient Iewes had alſo an eaſy way to know their ordinary Prieſts &amp; Paſtors, from vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: For, among them, none were Prieſts; but theſe, who were deſcended from Levi by Aaron, by natural generation. But, in the Law of grace, it is more eaſy; where none are to be eſteem'd Bishops &amp; Lawfull Paſtors, but the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, who are deſcended from the holy Apoſtles, by viſible ordination &amp; perſonal ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>The holy Fathers did vſe this ſucceſſion and Vocation of Paſtors, as a moſt evident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to demonſtrat the true Church; and by want of theſe, they diſcovered alſo as clearly all falſe Churches. For it's certain, the true Church cannot be without lawfull Paſtors, &amp; lawfull Paſtors cannot be without lawfull Vocation &amp; ordination; &amp;, where there are no true Paſtors, lawfully called and ordaind, there can be no true Church. S. Ireneus proves the true Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch, by the Succeſſion of Paſtors;<note place="margin">Irena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> which he calls a clear demonſtration, by which all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques are confounded. Tertullian requires the heretiques, to bring forth the origine of their Churches, to recite the order of their Bishops,<note place="margin">Tert. lib. de praeſcrip</note> by ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles. As it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then, that vocation &amp; ſucceſſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, by lawfull ordination, is an inſeparable propertie of the true Church: So We shall now briefly ſee, to which Church it beſt agrees,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:43743:204"/> whither to the Proteſtant, or to the Church in Communion with the Sea of Rome.</p>
               <p>I find, that the Proteſtant Paſtors are as much perplexed, to show the lawfulneſſe of their Vocation, after Luther, as they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, to show, where their Church was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. For they run from one shift to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, what ſome ſay, others controule &amp; ſeverly cenſure. As there were three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſorts of Proteſtants, to witt: the Lutherans, Calviniſts &amp; theſe of the late English Church; ſo, I find, they bring three different anſwers, to the queſtion of their Miniſters vocation. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſay, the Lutherian Miniſters have an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vocation, becauſe Luther was made a Prieſt in the Roman Church But this anſwer is frivolous. For firſt, Luther, by that Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, got only commiſſion to preach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of that Church, and not to preach againſt it. Secondly, it is monſtruouſly abſurd for the Lutherians, to derive their Vocation from that Church, which their firſt Apoſtle eſteem'd Anti-Chriſtian. Thirdly, Although Luthers own vocation were ſuppoſed to be good, how could he, being only a ſimple Prieſt, ordain others; ſince, from the beginning of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it was never known, that a Prieſt could be ordaind by any, but by a Bishop? Fourthly, Luther ſucceeded to none, neither Bishop or Prieſt, who profeſſed his doctrin; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, the Lutherans are, in their firſt ſource, deſtitute of ſucceſſion, and in their progreſſe, of lawfull ordination; and ſo neither Luther,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:43743:204"/> nor his ſucceſſors, have any lawfull Vocation.</p>
               <p>Calvin &amp; moſt of his Schollers renounce the way of ordinary, &amp; run to an extraordinary vocation: for they are ashamed, to derive their vocation from the Roman Church, which they imagine to be Anti-Chriſtian: neither can they do it, becauſe Calvin was never ordain'd a Prieſt. <hi>By the tyranny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But, that Calvin and his followers had no extraordinary vocation, may be eaſily shown. For, vnto that, there are two things requiſite, according to the examples, recorded in the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:43743:205"/> Scriptures. Firſt, that God ſpeak ſenſibly vnto one, whom he is to call extraordinarly: as he did to Moyſes, Elias, S. Paul Secondly, That he make that appeare by ſome miracle. The firſt is not ſufficient, without the ſecond: To which may be ioynd a third condition, to witt, holyneſſe of life &amp; doctrin, which becomes Gods extraordinary Ambaſſadours; without which, even their miracles ought to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Now, not only one, but all theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were viſibly deficient in Calvin &amp; the other pretended Reformers. For never any of them was ſo impudent, as to ſay, that God ſpake ſenſibly to them: albeit Luther confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that the Devil conferred oftner then once, with him.<note place="margin">Eraſm. in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, albeit the Catholique Bishops were granted to have impoſed their hands on the firſt Proteſtant Bishops: yet, by that ordination, they made them only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and not Proteſtant Bishops: for the Church in all reaſon, and common ſenſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a lawfull Vocation to any Paſtors, to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:43743:206"/> preach and act againſt her ſelf. Therefore, if theſe firſt Bishops of the late English Church were Proteſtants, when they were ordain'd; they were not lawfully ordaind: and, if they became thereafter Proteſtants, they loſt all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exercice of their power of ordination: when they vſed it againſt that Church, from which they pretend to derive their lawfull vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Laſtly, the firſt Proteſtant Bishops, in King Edward the ſixth or Queen Elizabeths time, ſucceeded to no other Proteſtant Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, much leſſe, can they show their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vnto the Apoſtles: as is requiſite to make them lawfull and Apoſtolical Bishops.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that the firſt Proteſtant Bishops were made by vertue of the King or Queens ſupremacie, and by act of parliament: This is not the way preſcryved in the Scripture, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich has been always obſerved in the Church. And, if theſe English Bishops &amp; Paſtors had no more ſure ground, for their vocation, then the Royal Supremacy; it is no wonder, that they are both falne together, and that one Parliament has ranſacted, what others had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted So we ſee, that the late English Church, has been reſolved into the ſame principles, of which it was firſt compoſed: as by the ſame iuſt iudgment, the Preſbyterians, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an extraordinary vocation, are almoſt ſubverted by the Independents &amp; Anabaptiſts vpon the ſame pretext.</p>
               <p>It reſts, that I ſpeak now a word of our Scottish Miniſters Vocation, which I found
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:43743:206"/> as groundleſſe, and more ridiculous, then any of the reſt. For, beſids, that the moſt part of them, at the beginning, were vnlettered men, and had no other Vocation to be Miniſters, then that which the Preſbyterians blame now in the Independents; the Vocation of M. <hi>Xnox</hi> our great Reformer ſeems very ſtrange, as it is deſcribed in his own Chronicle. In one thing indeed he shew himſelf more Scrupulous, then Luther: for although he had been ordain'd a Roman Prieſt; yet, he thought (not without reaſon) that his Popish orders gave him no lawfull Vocation to be a Proteſtant Miniſter: and therefore, he expected another call, which was given him, after this manner. Some diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Proteſtants, having conſpired toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had cruelly kill'd,<note place="margin">Spots woods in his hiſtory &amp;c.</note> (as a Proteſtant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeaks) Cardinal <hi>Beaton,</hi> within his own houſe, the caſtle of <hi>S. Andrewes,</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelvs of all the Cardinals riches; and thereafter kept out the Caſtle in rebellion againſt the State. To this place of ſecurity M. <hi>Knox</hi> had his refuge, carying along with him ſome Gentlemens children, whom he inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Grammar and new Catechiſme.<note place="margin">Knox Chron. p. <hi>74. 75</hi>
                  </note> His book ſaith, that, when theſe within the Caſtle perceived the manner of his doctrin; they dealt earneſtly with him, to take vpon him the function of a Preacher. But he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, alledging he would not run, where God had not ſent him; meaning, that he would do nothing without a lawfull calling. Wherevpon they, going to a private Councel, reſolve or
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:43743:207"/> give a charge publickly to M. Knox, by the mouth of their preacher <hi>Iohn Rough:</hi> which was done, at the next Sermon, as it is there at more length deſcribed. So by this means, M. <hi>Knox</hi> gote his Vocation to be a Miniſter, from the call of that holy Congregation, which was guiltie of murder and robbery, and was then in actual rebellion, by the mouth of their Preacher, who could have no lawfull voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion himſelf; but being an vnlettered man, had taken vp, by all appearance, that calling at his own hand; as many others did. For it is ſaid of him, in the 74. page. <hi>Albeit he was not the moſt learned, yet was his doctrin without corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. I was much aſtonished, when this hiſtorie of our firſt Reformer his Vocation was firſt shown me, in his own book, by a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, who did not faile, to manifeſt the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſneſſe of it, by all the circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Now theſe are all the different Vocations of the Proteſtant Miniſters, and all and every one of them are ſo vnſufficient, that they are diſproved not only by Catholiques, but alſo by moſt famous Proteſtants, who are brought to ſuch confuſion, in this matter, that they hardly know what to ſay. For they can neither pretend ordinary nor extraordinary Vocation: not the firſt; becauſe they evidently want ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, as alſo ordination: both which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to an ordinary calling. Not the ſecond: becauſe they want the power of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and have no extraordinary holyneſſe, which are qualities very requiſite and vſual for
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:43743:207"/> all Gods extraordinary Ambaſſadours. And albeit neither of theſe qualities were required; yet, theſe who pretend this extraordinary Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, do fall into ſuch contradictions, that they are evidently known thereby, not to be Gods extraordinary Ambaſſadours: whom he never vſeth to ſend with contrary Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: So that, to the Proteſtant Miniſters or Bishops, agree well the words of <hi>S. Cyprian.</hi>

               <p>Vpon the other part, this ſucceſſion of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops from the Apoſtles, has been ever ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in the Church of the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the holy Fathers did bring it, as a moſt evident argument, to show the true Church: and therefore, they reckon out ordinarly the ſucceſſion of the Roman Bishops.<note place="margin">Aug. cont. epiſt. fund. c. <hi>4.</hi>

Therefore, as the Church in Communion with the Sea of Rome has been shewed to be <hi>one holy</hi> and <hi>Catholique</hi> Church; ſo it is no leſſe evident, that it is <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique,</hi> having lawfull Paſtors (as it has ever had) deriving their Vocation from the holy Apoſtles, by lawfull ordination &amp; perſonal ſucceſſion: and conſequently, this is the true Church &amp; lawfull ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This matter of Vocation is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: becauſe doctrin depends vpon it; and becauſe it is eaſily diſcerned, ſo that, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by our Saviour,<note place="margin">

For, if they cannot bring evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimonies of their Vocation &amp; ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from a known Paſtor of the Church: they are preſently known to be Wolves, who run, when they were not ſent; who enter not by the doore, but climb vp another way. Therefore, it is great deceit in ſome Miniſters,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:43743:208"/> to vndertake to prove the lawfulneſſe of their Vocation, by the truth of their doctrin: which is a prepoſterous and ridiculous way.<note place="margin">

What would be more ridiculous, then, if one would vſurp the Office of a Iudge in the ſtate: and then would prove himſelf to be a lawfull Iudge, by the iuſtice of his deciſions? This queſtion then of Vocation, being ſo important and eaſy, a Catholique gave me this advice, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, God willing, to follow, never to admit a Miniſter to diſpute of religion, till he firſt shew the lawfulneſſe of his Vocation, and to make ever that the firſt queſtion.</p>

               <p>AS light is more pleaſant, after darkneſſe; ſo is the invention of truth more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, after errors. I have now, by Gods grace, and by the former Triall, ſeen, both our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:43743:209"/> Reformations (which were called ſuch great engyring Lights) to be nothing, but thick Aegyptian darkneſſe, obſcuring the chief and moſt clear truths of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: both in doctrin, &amp; diſciplin. I have now found amongſt the Proteſtants, what S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin obſerved amongſt the Manichees,<note place="margin">Aug. cont. epiſt. fund, c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> that they have nothing, but a meer promiſe of truth, a pretext of following only the Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed they follow their own Errors: That their doctrin is nothing, but counterfeit Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, which cannot endure the fire of Triall. Yea, I have clearly ſeen, that their Church, which is the ground work of all, has not the leaſt reſemblance of the Church of Chriſt; as she is without ambiguity deſcribed, in the Scriptures. For, according to them, the Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch of Chriſt muſt endure, for ever: But the Proteſtant Church has only endured, ſince the time of Luther. According to the Scriptures, the Church <hi>cannot be hid,</hi> but muſt ever shine, like a light, ſet vpon a Candleſtick: But the Proteſtant Church has lyen many hundred years hid and inviſible, vnder a bushell. The Church of Chriſt muſt have Vnity, as beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes the houſe of God: But the Proteſtant Church is full of diviſion &amp; confuſion, both in doctrin, &amp; diſciplin. The true Church muſt be holy, in all her doctrin, and fruitfull in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceing Saints: But the Proteſtant Church teacheth doctrines, which tend to prophaneſſe &amp; to the neglect of piety &amp; of all good works: and she is ſo barren, in produceing Saints, that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:43743:209"/> she profeſſeth to bring forth none, but thoſe who continually, or dayly, break mortally Gods Commandments. The true Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, muſt be Catholique or Vniverſal, and muſt convert all Nations from infidelity to Chriſtianity: But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church is only in parts &amp; pettie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth: and has never, as yet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted any Nation of Infidels; but, according to the nature of hereſy, has only perverted ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ill Catholiques. The true Church muſt ever have true Paſtors, lawfully called and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, deriving their Succeſſion, by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted line, from the holy Apoſtles: But the Proteſtant Churches firſt Paſtors ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to none; and, without any lawfull Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; ordination, did intrude themſelves by Vſurpation, into the Paſtoral office, as all their ſucceſſors have done. The true Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres ſo cloſly to the truth, that she is called in the Scriptures, <hi>The pillar &amp; ground of truth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 3.15.</note> But the Proteſtant Church is ſo inconſtant, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from one falshood into another; that she may be called <hi>the Pillar &amp; ground of Error.</hi> The true Church, according to Chriſts promiſe, is ever directed by the Spirit of truth, into all truth: But the Proteſtant Church is miſgover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the Spirit of giddineſſe; as is known by fresh experience. Theſe conſiderations, beſides others, make me ſee the great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherein I lay, and have made me to admire of my former blindneſſe; that I, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo frequently the Scriptures, did not ſee
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:43743:210"/> the monſtrous difference, which is between the Church of Chriſt, there ſo clearly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the Proteſtant Church, to which not one propertie of the true Church contain'd in the Scriptures doth agree. This shew me, how neceſſary it is to read the Scriptures with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and to implore the Divine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty for ſpirituall illumination; without which darkneſſe will ſeem light, and light dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>But in the holy Catholique Church, I found not only promiſe, but alſo perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of truth. I found her faith to be <hi>more pretious then gold, which is tried by the fire,</hi> as S. Peter ſpeaks;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7.</note> which, after greateſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and triall, doth ever shine more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I found, in this Church, clearly fulfilled, all the Propheſies, and that to her do agree all the properties of the true Church, deſcribed in the Scriptures. For this is the Church, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich alone has endured, ſince the time of the Apoſtles. This is the Church, which, as a Citie ſeated on a hill, could never be hid: but, as a Candle ſet vpon a Candleſtick, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned the whole world. This is the Church, which has been admirable for its Vnity, and eminent for its ſanctity: replenishing the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with innumerable Saints, who have all lived and died, in the boſome of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. This is the Church, which is Vniverſal for time &amp; place, which has had her gates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually open night and day, to receive the ſtrength of the Gentils, which she alone has

This is the Church, which has had a continued ſucceſſion of Paſtors, deſcending, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, from the holy Apoſtles.

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> Of the great eſteem, and high Titles of the Covenant; and that it was vniuſtly called, Gods Covenant.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE reſpect, which the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters gave to the Covenant, was ſo great, that perhaps it may ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible vnto poſterity. For they eſteemd it as much, as if God had ſent it from heaven, or had given expreſſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for making it. They were not content, to eſteem it ſo much themſelvs, but they would have all perſons, within their power, to do the ſame; They were not ſatisfyed with mens ſimple profeſſion to beleeve it: but they enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all perſons, to ſwear and ſubſcribe it, yea, and to take their Sacrament vpon it, and were reſolved by furious zeal, to propagate it by force, throughout the world. They gave it alſo high Titles: calling it ordinarily <hi>Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> or the <hi>Covenant between God and the Kirk of Scotland: The Confeſsion of faith: The holy Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. All which shew their great eſteem of it.</p>
               <p>At the very firſt ſerious view, and once rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over of the Covenant, we preſently ſaw, that it did not deſerve theſe high Titles, and eſpecially of <hi>Gods Covenant:</hi> becauſe it containd
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:43743:213"/> ſome moſt groſſe and palpable lies, of which, we obſerved three moſt obvious.</p>
               <p>The firſt is containd in the very firſt words of the Covenant, which begin thus. <hi>We all, and every one of vs vnderwritten, proteſt, that, after long and due examination of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, in matters of true &amp; falſe religion,</hi> &amp;c. where they profeſſe to have vſed long &amp; due examination of their Conſciences, before they ſwore and ſubſcribed the Covenant. Now this is a falshood ſo manifeſt, that men need not to examine their conſcienſces: but only to recollect their ſenſes, and conſider, what their eys ſaw done, to diſcover it. For, when the Covenant was ſubſcrived, at the beginning of the Troubles, anno 1638. in the Grayfriers Church of <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> all the long examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then vſed, was to heare it once read over, accompanied with a Panegyrick, made by the Lord <hi>Lowdon,</hi> and a prayer by M. <hi>Henderſon:</hi> and immediatly thereafter, all almoſt, who were preſent, ran contentiouſly to it. Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſt of the Countrey, the Miniſters commendation of it was made to ſerve, for all the peoples long &amp; due examination, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently followed their ſubſcription, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith vpon the Miniſters bare word: wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich is no ſure ground to relie vpon. The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans ran to it every where, with little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and furious Zeal, that they might pull down the Bishops: and the old Proteſtants, being awakned by their falſe Alarmes, did ſwear and ſubſcribe it inconfideratly; that they
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:43743:214"/> might oppoſe the entrance of Popery, which, they were made beleeve, to be at the doore. So that, it is evident, even to ſenſe, that few of the Covenanters vſed any diligence, moſt of them vſed none at all, and none of them vſed long and due examination of their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but their Subſcriptions and oaths went before their knowledge, and their knowledge before due Trial and diligence. Whereof this is an evident ſign, that, as yet, after 19. years agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, few of their chief heads know all the points abiured in the Covenant, as <hi>opus opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, works of Supererogation, Stations,</hi> and the like. Therefore, the firſt words of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are manifeſtly falſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond groſſe vntruth is a little after the Middle of the Covenant, in theſe words. <hi>And, ſeing many are ſtirred vp by Satan and the Roman Anti-Chriſt, to promiſe, ſwear &amp; ſubſcribe, and for a time vſe the holy Sacraments of the Kirk deceitfully, againſt their own Conſciences: mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, firſt, under the external Cloak ef re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to corrupt and ſubvert ſecretly Gods true religion, within the Kirk: and afterward, when time may ſerve, to become open Enemies and Perſecutors of the ſame: vnder Vain hopes of the Popes diſpenſation, deviſed againſt Gods word, to his greater Confuſion, and to their double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, in the day of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> &amp;c. Here, ſaid the Catholique, are linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diverſe lies, and not only lies, but calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and both ſo evidently falſe &amp; impudent; that the Father of lies, if he had any shame,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:43743:214"/> might be ashamed of them. For what can be more falſe, and malitious, then to ſay, that the Pope ſtirres vp Catholiques, to ſwear and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrybe the Proteſtant, &amp; to abiure the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion, againſt their Conſciences? That he ſtirres them vp, to vſe the Proteſtants Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and that of purpoſe, to ſubvert their religion, vnder hope of his diſpenſation? Firſt, the Catholique Church hath ever conſtantly taught, with S. Paul, that no evil is to be done,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note> that good may come of it, and therefore, much leſſe is the greateſt of evils to be done, ſuch as is, the renouncing of the Catholique faith, and ſwearing of a contrary Religion, againſt the light of a mans conſcience. Secondly, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the <hi>Helcheſits,</hi> in the primitive times,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> as Heretiques; for affirming, that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Chriſtians, to deny Chriſt externally, in the time of torments &amp; perſecution. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Popes, of whom, the Puritans think no ſin to lie, are ſo far from ſtirring vp Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, to do the forſaid abominations, that they earneſtly dehort them from approaching to the leaſt degree of ſuch impiety. Which, to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe by other Inſtances, may be known by the Breviat of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, directed to the English Catholiques, in <hi>October,</hi> 1606. Where he ſaith: <hi>We have vnderſtood, that you are compelled by the threatnings of moſt grievous paines, to go vnto the Temples of Heretiques, to frequent their Meetings, to be preſent at their Sermons: Truly we vndoubtedly beleeve, that thoſe, who, with ſo great Conſtancy and courage
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:43743:215" rendition="simple:additions"/> have ſuffered moſt fierce perſecutions, and almoſt infinit miſeries, will never treſpaſſe ſo, as to be defiled with the ſociety of the deſertors of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Law. Nevertheleſſe, We, being ſtirred vp by the zeal of our Paſtoral charge, and out of the Fatherly care we have, of the Salvation of your ſoules, are forced to admonish and earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you: that, by no means, you would go vnto the Temples of Heretiques, or heare their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or communicat with them in Rites: leaſt you incurre the wrath of God. For it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for you, to do theſe things, without the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Divin worship, and of your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> If the Pope dehorts ſo earneſtly the Catholiques, from going to the heretiques Temples; how much more doth he dehort them, from abiuring the Catholique faith, and from receiving the Puritans Sacraments? If the Pope only connived at ſuch actions, it would be a lie and calumnie great enough, to ſay, he ſtirred vp Catholiques to do them. But it is a monſtrous lie and calumnie, to ſay, he ſtirres vp men to do ſuch abominations, when he ſtirres them vp to the contrary. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Covenanters ever shew, that any Pope did otherwiſe, ſince ever the Proteſtant religion began. The Catholiques beleeve, that God has ſuch a care of his Church, that it needs not, by periuries, diſſimulations, or any falſe wayes, to be advanced: and they know alſo, that all hereticall Churches need not, by ſuch vniuſt means, to be by them ſubverted. For, by their own diviſions, they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:43743:215" rendition="simple:additions"/> to ſubvert themſelvs; as long experience hath shewed. Laſtly, it is falſe, that theſe Catholiques, who, againſt their conſciences, renounce their religion; do it vpon hopes of the Popes Diſpenſation: For all Catholiques know, that the Pope, as he himſelf profeſſeth, cannot diſpence in any thing, that is intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally evil, and againſt the eternal Law of God; as that action is, in the higheſt degree. All which may be known to moderate Proteſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts, even by the Confeſſion of Apoſtat Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</p>
               <p>Therefore, theſe being ſo groundleſſe lies, and malitious calumnies, the Covenant did well to begin them with the Father of lies; for thus it ſpeaks: <hi>And, ſeing many are ſtirred vp by Satan &amp; the Roman Anti-Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. But it had been no lie, if the Miniſters had been yoaked with the Devil in that work: For they have concurred oftentimes with him, to draw and force diverſe Catholiques, to renounce their faith, againſt their conſciences: as has been known by many late experiences, ſince the Covenant began.</p>
               <p>But it is ſtrange, to ſee famous Proteſtants, yea, and the very ſame Accuſers, guilty of the ſame Crimes, which they falſly lay to the charge of others, which may be shewed by their own Monuments. Who is eſteem'd a more famous Proteſtant, then Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, the Foundreſſe of the Late English Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch? And yet she is taxed by M. <hi>Knox,</hi> for faigning her ſelf to have been a Papiſt, for
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:43743:216"/> bowing to <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Knox Chron. pag. <hi>226</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and going to Maſſe,</hi> all the time of her Siſter Queen Maries reigne. It is known alſo, how shortly, after her ſiſters death, she ſubverted, all that in her lay, the Catholique religion; albeit she ſware to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, at her Coronation. Who gave her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to vſe ſuch diſſimulation in religion? Surely it was not the Pope; but rather she, as head of her own Church, which is now alſo ſubverted, did diſpence with her ſelf. It is yet fresh in all mens memorie, how many of the Puritans did ſwear obedience to their Bishops, and conformity to the late English Churches orders: and yet, when time ſerved, they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted both. who gave them Diſpenſations for ſuch hypocriſies and periuries? That is one of their rare privileges, that they all, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, by more then Papal power, can diſpence with themſelvs: as Becan shewes, in a ſpecial Treatiſe of their Privileges.</p>
               <p>The third groſſe vntruth of the Covenant, followeth, in theſe words. <hi>We therefore, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take away all ſuſpicion of hypocriſy, and of ſuch double dealing with God and his Kirk, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and call the Searcher of all hearts to witneſſe, that our Minds and hearts do fully agree, with this our Confeſſion, oath, and ſubſcription: ſo that we are not moved, for any worldly reſpect, but are perſwaded only in our Conſciences,</hi> &amp;c. As the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foundation was falſe, ſo is this fabrique which is raiſed on it. For the moſt rigid Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters know, that many thowſand Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were made to put their hands to the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:43743:216"/> Covenant, whoſe hearts were far from it: and when they could, shew both their hearts &amp; hands againſt it. And they were ſo far, from being moved, without worldly reſpects; that for theſe only, they were induced to take the Covenant; and, ſo ſoone as theſe failed, they abandoned it.</p>
               <p>By all which, it is evident, that this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which containes ſo many groſſe lies and Calumnies, againſt very ſenſe and experience, cannot be the Covenant of God; who Loves truth, and hates lies.</p>

               <p>THE Covenant carieth this Title in print. <hi>The National Covenant, or Confeſsion of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. But it appeared very ſoon to vs, not to deſerve that Title; but rather that it ought to be called; a <hi>Confoſſion, or Denyal of the faith,</hi> which it deny's not ſimply, but with many horrible execrations and blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>All hereſies are of a Malignant Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in denyal of ſome points of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith: But there are ſome, which deny fewer, and others more points of it. In the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, ſome hereſies were caſt out of the Church, for one word only againſt the faith: But the Covenant and Preſbyterian religion
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:43743:217" rendition="simple:additions"/> deny almoſt al the points of the Catholique faith. For they run through heaven &amp; earth, the Church Triumphant and Militant, they leave neither God nor man, the Angels nor the Saints, the living nor the dead vntouched: but they rob every one of them, of ſome excellent privilege. For they ſpoile God of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by making him the Author of ſin: Chriſt of his merits, by denying he dyed for all; and the holy Trinity of Glory. They ſpoile the Angels and the Saints of their felicity, and of all reſpect and reverence from men They rob the Church of the continual aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; Man of his free-will, the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prayers of the Saints, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full departed of the ſuffrages of the living. They rob the Sacraments of Grace, and the Commandments of obedience. Yea, what have they left vntouched, in the Church? They have taken away many books of the Scriptures, almoſt all the Sacraments, all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Prieſthood, Sacrifice Vowes, ſet Faſts, Feſtival Dayes, Altars, Reliques, Holy Images, all Monuments of Piety, all the antient Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Lawes, all Order and Diſciplin, all Comlineſſe and beauty from the Houſe of God. They have abolished the Apoſtolique Government, denyed the Apoſtles Creed, ſubverted the Divine Commandments, and abiured all the Evangelical Counſels, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more points have they deſtroyed, as we shall ſee, in the progreſſe of the Covenant; ſo, that never any hereſy deſerved more the title

               <p>As the matter of the Covenant is very large, containing ſo many points of the Catholique Faith, which it deny's; ſo the manner, how it doth renounce them (which is as it were the life and forme of the Covenant) is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. For it doth not only deny theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: but it deteſts and abiures them, yea and blaſphemes them, adding a blaſphemous Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet, almoſt to every point. For thus it ſpeaks: We renounce and deteſt the <hi>Vſurped authority of the Roman Anti-Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>wicked</hi> Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, his <hi>Devilish</hi> Maſſe, <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>Profane</hi> Sacrifice, <hi>Baſtard</hi> Sacraments, <hi>Doubtſome</hi> Faith, <hi>Deſperat</hi> Repentance, &amp;c.</p>

                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>To paſſe by the firſt ſenſible vntruth, about the long and due examination of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which was lately touched; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend next, that they are fully perſwaded of the truth of their Religion, by the word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. But this is no new ſong, neither is it only peculiar to them. All ſects, although never ſo monſtrous, which receiv'd the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, have made, and do make the ſame pretexts: And this they muſt all do, or elſe they would get few followers. But that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters make this pretext as falſly, as any other ſects, is very evident. For firſt, they falſly pretend to be perſwaded of the truth of their Religion, by the word of God, ſeing they beleeve diverſe points, as principal arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their religion, which are expreſly againſt
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:43743:219"/> the word of God. Which may be shown by many Inſtances: but we shall be content with two or three. The Covenanters beleeve, as the principal article of their religion, that <hi>man is iuſtifyed by faith only,</hi> which is clearly againſt the word of God, which ſaith in expreſſe tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: <hi>Man is not iuſtifyed by faith only.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 2.24.</note> They beleeve, that the Commandments <hi>are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be kept:</hi> Which is againſt the word of God, which affirmeth that Gods <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not grievous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.3.</note> and that Zachary &amp; Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth did keep them. They beleeve, that the Euchariſt <hi>is not the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1 6.</note> which is directly againſt the Scripture, which affirmeth: <hi>It is his body and blood:</hi> and that, with ſuch words, as deſign the true body &amp; true blood. Therefore, it is evident, that they cannot be perſwaded of the truth of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by the Word of God, ſeing the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal articles of their religion are ſo clearly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainſt the word of God. Yea, before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can be true, the moſt clear truth in all the Scriptures muſt be falſe, to witt: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of the Church of Chriſt. For their whole religion is founded vpon that ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the whole Church of Chriſt had become Anti-Chriſtian, and had perished, for a long time, before Luther: Then which, nothing can be more againſt the word of God, as we have ſeen above. Neither have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters any other refuge, to shun theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, between their beleef and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but to fly vnto tropes &amp; figures, and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:43743:220"/> pretend, that theſe places of Scripture muſt be vnderſtood figuratively: which is the very frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that was vſed by the auncient heretiques. <hi>So ſoone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. lib <hi>3.</hi> de doct. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. <hi>6.10.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith S. Auguſtin, <hi>as any Error doth prepoſſeſſe their mynds: they eſteem all to be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, which the Scripture ſaith to the contrary.</hi> Yea, they muſt bring ſenſes, iuſt contrary vnto the words of the Scriptures: as for example, the Scripture ſaith: <hi>Man is not iuſtifyed by faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which, according to their beleef, muſt be vnderſtood, as if the Scripture ſaid, <hi>Man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed by faith only:</hi> which it nowhere ſaith. Therefore, if men can be perſwaded by the Scripture, to beleeve ſuch things, as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſſe words of Scripture; the Covenanters are perſwaded by the Scripture, of the truth of their religion: otherwiſe they are not; but rather perſwaded to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they come as ſmall ſpeed of their pretext, of the Spirit of God. For firſt they can bring no more ground for it, then all ſects do, that is their own bare words: and therefore, they ought not to be beleeved more, then others. Secondly, They cannot be perſwaded, by the Spirit of God, who oppoſe the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, which, according to Chriſts promiſe, is ever directed by the Spirit of Truth. S. Iohn, who adviſeth vs wiſely, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve every Spirit; but to prove the Spirits, if they be of God, gives this Touch-ſtone, by which they may be tryed. <hi>He that knoweth God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaith he, knoweth vs, and he that is not of God, knoweth vs not. In this, we know the Spirit
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:43743:220"/> of Truth and of Error.</hi> This ſame Touch-ſtone has held in all ſucceding generations. For the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, who would not beleeve the Catholique Church, and the Paſtors thereof, ſucceeding vnto the Apoſtles: although they bragged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, of the Spirit of God, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſeen to be miſled by the Spirit of Error, and were condemned as heretiques; who, with inſolent folly, would appropriat the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God vnto every one of their own giddie heads, and yet deny it to the whole Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church, againſt the clear Scriptures The ſame holds againſt Calvin &amp; his deſcendents, the Preſbyterian Covenanters. Thirdly, They cannot have the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of Vnity, who have mingled among them, the Spirit of giddineſſe, and Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: by which their Erroneous Spirit is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered now, even to the moſt ſimple among the people. Laſtly, the Covenanters falſly pretend that they are <hi>fully</hi> perſwaded, of the truth of their religion. For, if they had full aſſurance of it, they would not make ſo many changes in it: and beſides, their Director is very vnconſtant: for what is more changeable, then the privat Spirit?</p>
               <p>Having ſeen now, ſaid the Catholique, the Covenanters vain &amp; falſe pretence of the word and Spirit of God, we will briefly run through the deſcription of their religion: and, to ſpare paines of often repeating their names, we will turn our ſpeech to them. Firſt, you ſay: that your faith &amp; religion is the only true faith, &amp;
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:43743:221"/> religion pleaſing God, and bringing Salvation to man. If this were true, the world, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages had been in a pittifull condition. For, about the ſpace of a thowſand, or 12. hundred yeares, your faith &amp; religion were not known; and ſo all that time, there had been no means of ſalvation. By which device, you not only controule the clear Scriptures: but alſo show your ſelvs enemies to the Glory of Chriſt, to the riches of his Grace, and to the perpetuity of his Kingdome, yea and to the very good of Man. And laſtly you oppoſe moſt famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who acknowledge, Salvation was had in the Roman Church, before Luther; and may be had now after him; in ſo much, that King Iames, in his ſpeech to the Parlament, 1605. sharply cenſures you, for this cruel opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>We confes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that many Papiſts, (eſpecially our Anceſtors,) &amp;c. may be ſaved: and often are ſaved: deteſting, in this parte, and iudging worthy of fire the cruelty of Puritans, who yeeld Salvation to no Papiſt.</hi> Secondly, you deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe your religion further, ſaying that it is <hi>now reveald to the world, by the preaching of the Evangel.</hi> But that is rather a mark of the falſe, then of the true religion. For the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith was reveald of old, by Chriſt &amp; his holy Apoſtles; and from that time, could never be hid: But your Preſbyterian faith has iuſt two contrary qualities, to witt: it is <hi>now</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, and has lyen long hid. S. Vincentius Lyrinenſis sheweth the nature of your faith, by deſcribing the doctrine of the auncient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:43743:221"/> 
                  <hi>What do they propoſe,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Vincent Lyr. cont. haereſ. c. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but new and vnheard doctrines. For you shall heare ſome of them ſay. Come ô you vnwiſe &amp; miſerable men, (who are commonly called Catholiques) &amp; learn the true faith, which, beſides vs, none knoweth; which has lyen hidd many ages, but now is lately revealed and manifeſted.</hi> Neither doth it a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te availe you, that you call your faith the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and the revealing of your faith, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel. For ſo, all heretiques call their greateſt Errors, the Goſpel of Chriſt. S. Hierom ſaith wiſely, <hi>that the Goſpel of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>1.</hi> ad Galat.</note> 
                  <hi>by a falſe interpretation, becames the Evangel of man: or, which is wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe, the Evangel of the Devil.</hi> So there ſtill remaines a great queſtion about the truth of your preaching; which is nothing but your privat interpretation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to make your faith more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, you pretend, that it is both auncient &amp; Vniverſal. You pretend Vniverſality, when you ſay, that your faith is beleeved, received, and defended, by many Notable Kirks and Realmes, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland. Next you lay claime to a certain kind of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, when you ſay, that it hath been of <hi>a long time</hi> openly profeſſed. Such is the evidence of Truth, that Enemies to it are ſometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, to make vſe, or rather a shew of it.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak firſt of the vniverſality of your faith: where are all theſe many notable Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and Kirks, which you affirm do profeſſe your religion? In Europe no ſuch Kingdomes can be found. For <hi>Swedland</hi> &amp; <hi>Denmark</hi> are
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:43743:222"/> known to be Lutherians, who have neither Vnity of faith with you, nor Communion in Sacraments, and abhorre the very name of Calvin, &amp; of all Sacramentaries. The Realme &amp; late Church of England maintaind the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy of the Church, abhorring very much the Anarchy of your Preſbytery: and now, ſince England became a Commonwealth, it hates nothing more then the Soule-Tyranny, as it is commonly called there, of your Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. The other famous Kingdomes of Europe are either totally, or for the much greater part, Roman Catholiques: So that, the many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Realmes of your religion, are as yet invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, vnleſſe you would count all thoſe to be of your religion, who are not Papiſts, or who go vnder the general name of Proteſtants. But that cannot be done; for the Vniverſality of a Church requires Vnity in faith, &amp; Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Sacraments, which you evidently want, with a great part of Proteſtant Churches. And therefore, knowing that you want this Vnity; you wiſely pretend, that this faith, which you ſo much praiſe, is <hi>chiefly</hi> profeſſed by the Kirk of Scotland. For every one of you pretends to be chief, and will not yeeld to another.</p>
               <p>Then yow come as little ſpeed of your Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. For all the long time, that your faith was profeſt, from the beginning of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to the firſt making of the Covenant, is but about 20. years, and as yet to this day, it has not paſt the bounds of one Age. If you had the Vniverſality &amp; Antiquity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:43743:222"/> Church, how would you glory; when you make ſuch a ſtirre, with your fewneſſe and Novelty? For your one Kingdome, and your one hundred years, in which your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has been profeſſed: we can show you the ſame Kingdome, profeſſing the Catholique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, above 14. hundred years; and all the famous Chriſtian Kingdomes and Countries of the world, making the ſame profeſſion, even to the firſt time of their Converſion, from Infidelity to Chriſtianity. And for your one King, mentioned in your Covenant, which he took in his younger years; diſproveing it, when he became more ripe: as appears in the Conference, at Hampton-Court; we can show you 80. Kings of the ſame Nation, diverſe of which are glorious Saints in heaven, who lived and dyed in the Catholique Profeſſion; To whom we may add, all the famous Chriſtian Kings &amp; Emperours, that have been in the world.</p>
               <p>But, albeit you were more ſpread, then you are: you would find no great advantage by it: S. Auguſtin compareing you, with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to ſmoake,<note place="margin">Aug. ſerm. <hi>2.</hi> in. Pſal. <hi>36.</hi>
                  </note> which doth vanish ſo much the ſooner, by how much it is greater, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re dilated abroad. This we have ſeen verifyed, in our time. For the late Church of England, intending to dilate her ſelf in Scotland, did shortly thereafter vanish like ſmoake in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Again, the Scottish Preſbytery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring with great zeal, to propagate it ſelf in England, loſt ſoone much of its fyrie
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:43743:223"/> force in Scotland. Secondly, Antiquity of your religion would tend no leſſe to your rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: for, as S. Hierom hath obſerved, all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies pleaſe only men for a time, and when they grow old, they weare out of requeſt as may be known, by the many alterations of religion, that have happened in Scotland; but eſpecially in England, ſince their publique fall from the Catholique religion.</p>
               <p>Then, for Acts of Parlament, whereby you ſay your faith is confirmed; they cannot be very many, ſeing the religion is ſo late: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they give great confirmation to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: becauſe they are very changeable. We ſee one Proteſtant Parliament has ranſacted the Kings Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>remacy, which many Proteſtant Parliaments had enacted: and that, which was before declared Hereſy, if not Treaſon, to deny, is now iudged both great follie and Treaſon to affirme. The true religion is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by a higher authority, then by earthly Courts: But the Proteſtant religions are made, and vnmade, by Proteſtant Parliaments.</p>
               <p>The laſt point here propoſed containes three vntruths linked together; as where you ſay, that you all willingly agree in all points: All the Horologes of the world will ſooner agree, then your wills. When coercive power is now taken out of your hands, you ſee, how many do willingly &amp; freely diſagree from you. Then you call all the points of your faith, Gods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, which they cannot be, beſides other reaſons; becauſe many Proteſtants doubt
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:43743:223"/> of diverſe of them, yea they think them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted falshoods: and beſides, yourſelves are often changeing them: which shewes, that many articles of your faith are doubtſome; and your faith of them is nothing, but meer opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is moſt falſe, that all your faith is grounded only vpon the written word: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you beleeve ſome things, without the word of God, as the changeing of the Sabboth into Sunday, the baptizing of infants; and, which is more, you beleeve ſome points againſt the expreſſe word of God; as your article of Iuſtification by faith only, to ſpeak nothing of diverſe others.

                  <hi>SECTION IV.</hi> Of the Popes Supremacy: where it is shewed, that the Pope is not Anti-Chriſt, nor an Vſurper: as the Covenanters do calumniate.</head>
               <p>AFTER the former Preface, follow the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe words of the</p>

                     <hi>And therefore, we abhorre and deteſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion &amp; Doctrin; but chiefly all kind of Papiſtry, in generall and particular heads, even, as they are now damned &amp; confuted, by the word of God, and Kirk of Scotland. But in ſpecial, we deteſt and refuſe the Vſurped Authority of the Roman Anti Chriſt, vpon the Scriptures of God, vpon the kirk, the Civil Magiſtrate, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Here you ingenuouſly confeſſe your ſelves, to have one quality, which all heretiques have ever had; to hate and deteſt moſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion. And your practice sheweth, this your Confeſſion to be true. For, albeit any perſon become a <hi>Socinian, Anabaptiſt,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt;</hi> you take no great notice of him; but, if you heare of any, that is become a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> he is ſure to get no more reſt. Next, as you falſly pretended your faith to be contain'd in the word of God: ſo now, as groundleſly, you
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:43743:224"/> pretend, the Catholique faith to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſame word, which, as yet, you could never make good, in any one point. It is true indeed, that the Catholique Church is condemned by the Church of Scotland: But it is as true, that the Church of Scotland is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Catholique Church, which is of far greater authority, and which has iudged &amp; condemned all former Hereſies, and Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over them.</p>
               <p>Now followes your diſmall ſong, with your abiurations &amp; deteſtations of the Faith, Order, &amp; Diſciplin of the Catholique Church; and firſt, you ſtrick at the Viſible head and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it, vnder Chriſt, whom you call Anti-Chriſt: deteſting his Authority, which you call vſurped. The principal reaſon, for which you beleeve this ſtrange article of your faith, to witt, <hi>that the Pope is Anti-Chriſt,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he claimes Primacy over other Bishops, and extends his care over the whole Church, which he affirmes to be committed to his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, as vnto S. Peters Succeſſor. If your reaſon were good, then S. Peter himſelf had been the firſt Anti-Chriſt: For both the Scriptures and Fathers show, that he received from Chriſt, the primacy over the other Apoſtles, and that the care of the whole Church was entruſted to him. S. Mathew shewes, that Peter was the firſt of the Apoſtles. <hi>The names,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>mon, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Peter.</hi> Now Peter was not firſt in calling, but in preeminence. For (as S. Ambroſe ſaith
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:43743:225"/> in 2. Cor. 12.) <hi>Andrew firſt followed our Saviour, before Peter: and yet the Primacy Andrew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not, but Peter.</hi> The ſame is showed by the change of his name, which Chriſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the 1. of S. Iohn, and thereafter perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 16.</note> in S Mathew: where he ſaid: <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> or a Rock, <hi>and vpon this Rock, will I build my Church</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I will give vnto thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, &amp;c.</hi> This change of the name of Simon into <hi>Peter,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by Chriſt, and thereafter performed by him, is not without great myſtery: and theſe excellent privileges, which our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him, of the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, &amp; of binding and looſing, do show, that he was particularly to grace and advance him, above others, which he performed after his reſurrection; when he ſaid to him: <hi>Feed my sheep, feed my Lambs;</hi> giving him thereby the charge of his whole flock.<note place="margin">5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.16.</note> The ſame Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of S. Peter may be showed, by many other preeminences, recorded in Scripture; as how Chriſt prayed particularly for him, <hi>that his faith might not faile,</hi> and <hi>payed Tribut for him:</hi> but for brevities ſake, they are omitted.</p>

For, to whom of all, I ſay, not only Bishops, but Apoſtles were the sheep ſo abſolutely, and without limitation committed? If thou loveſt me, Peter, feed my sheep. He ſaith not the people of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or that Citie; but my sheep, without all diſtinction.</hi> So S. Bernard. By which Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; Teſtimonies, both of the Scriptures and Fathers, you ſee, what ſolid ground the Popes authority hath, that it was confer'd by Chriſt on S. Peter; and that it has been acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the holy Fathers &amp; Chriſtian world, in the Bishops of Rome his Succeſſors. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you very rashly have reiected this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which has been eſtablished &amp; confirmed, by Chriſts ſpecial providence, vnto this day; but more wickedly do you call it an vſurped Tyranny, and beleeve the Pope (for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating and exerciſing the ſame authority) to be the great Anti-Chriſt; whereas you ought to acknowledge him, to be the Vicar of Chriſt. Theſe, who honour &amp; reverence the Authority of the Bishops of Rome, &amp; of the Apoſtolique Sea, follow the example of all the holy Fathers and auncient good Chriſtians: but theſe, who now a dayes endeavour to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and revile them, have the Heretiques for their Predeceſſors, who never caried good-will to them. S. Auguſtin shewes, that the Donatiſts called the Apoſtolique Sea, <hi>the Chair of Peſtilence:</hi> but that is nothing, to the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets of the Covenanting Miniſters. Who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:43743:226"/> in railings and blaſphemies, all that ever ſpoke: when they fall vpon this point; making thereby the ſimple people beleeve, that Anti-Chriſtian article of their faith, that the Pope is Anti-Chriſt. But the holy Fathers tooke it for an vndoubted mark, that theſe, who did not acknowledge the Popes authority, and were not of his Communion, belonged not to Chriſt, but to Anti-Chriſt. S. Hierom, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to S, Damaſus, ſaith: <hi>who gathereth not with thee, ſcattereth: that is, who it not Chriſts, is Anti-Chriſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having now ſeen, that the Pope (whom the Covenanters call malitiouſly Anti-Chriſt) is the Vicar of Chriſt: it remaines evident, that his Authority is lawfull, &amp; not vſurped. For he, who is a iuſt Poſſeſſor, is no Vſurper. Yea he has been ſo far, from vſurping over the Scriptures, the Church, &amp;c. that he has chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly preſerved them, from the Vſurpations and corruptions of Heretiques. And firſt, it is shewed, that he doth not vſurp over the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as the Covenanters do calumniate: For he neither Vſurps over the letter, nor the ſenſe of them. Not the firſt. For both the Pope &amp; whole Catholique Church profeſſe, that they only declare, that to be Scripture, which they received for ſuch, from the holy Apoſtles: and it's by their care &amp; diligence, that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scripture has deſcended pure, &amp; free from corruptions, vnto our hands: whereas, it might have been altogether corrupted, or totally perished, for Proteſtants. Neither do
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:43743:227"/> the Pope, or Catholique Church vſurp over the ſenſe of the Scriptures: but they preſerve that ſenſe, which is conforme to the Vanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the auncient fathers, &amp; of the Primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Church. Secondly, the Pope doth not vſurp over the Church: becauſe the care and charge of it was committed by Chriſt, to S. Peter, and to his Succeſſors: as we have ſeen: and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Church, from the Vſurpation of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques. Thirdly, He doth not vſurp over the Civil Magiſtrate. The experience of many ages, in all Chriſtians Kingdomes &amp; Common-wealths, is more then ſufficient, to make this good: &amp; to manifeſt the impudent falshood of the Preſbyterian calumnie, to the contrary. Fourthly, The Pope doth not vſurp over the Conſciences of men, but as chief Governor of the Church, has lawfull authority to make Eccleſiaſtical Lawes, which bind in Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; as alſo all the iuſt Lawes of Kings &amp; other Civil Magiſtrats do bind in Conſcience, to which their ſubiects ought to obey, according to that of S. Paul: <hi>Be ſubiect, not only for wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5.</note> And the contrary doctrin of Proteſtants, which affirmeth, that neither the Lawes of Church, Kings, or other Magiſtrates do bind in conſcience, is much deteſted by the Catholique Church, and opens a broad way to all diſobedience.</p>
               <p>But now, it will not be amiſſe to show, how yow are deſtitute of all lawfull authority and deeply guilty of the ſame Vſurpations, which yow falſly impoſe on others. Firſt, all
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:43743:227"/> heretiques, who go out of the Church, and having no lawfull calling, or authority, take vpon them to be Paſtors, and impoſe their new doctrines &amp; Lawes, vpon the Church, are truly Vſurpers, and are called <hi>Theeves</hi> by our Saviour; who enter not by the doore, but climb vp another way. So S. Optatus ſpeaks to the Donatiſts: <hi>How comes it to paſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Opt. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cont. Parmen.</note> ſaith he, <hi>that you, who are fighting againſt the Chair of Peter, by your preſumptions and Sacrilegious boldneſſe, contend to Vſurp the keies of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to your ſelves.</hi> Thus Luther &amp; Calvin, the two chief. Apoſtles of Proteſtants, were Vſurpers; who, being private men, without any lawfull calling, or authority, would bring in new doctrines, and preſcribe lawes to the whole Catholique Church. And in this, the Covenanting Miniſters do imitate them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they vſurped in particular, over both the letter and ſenſe of the Scriptures. For Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added the word <hi>Only</hi> to them, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iuſtification, and tooke the whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of S. Iames, and the Apocalypſe from them. Calvin alſo, by his private Spirit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vp a new Canon, not known before his time: expunging many bookes avnciently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, out of the Scriptures: which new Rule the Covenanters follow. Then, for the ſenſe, they tranſgreſſed the bounds ſet by the Fathers, reiecting the auncient ſenſe preſerved by the Catholique Church, and invented new ſenſes of their own imaginations, which they enforced vpon others, as divine Truths. In
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:43743:228"/> this alſo, you Covenanting Miniſters, have followed cloſely their footſteps. For you have been no leſſe fertile, in inventing ſuch new ſenſes; then active, in enforceing them vpon others. Thirdly, your pretended Reformers were Vſurpers over the Church, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no lawfull calling, nor authority, tooke vpon them to be Reformers of the Church: who would impoſe their own fancies, as lawes &amp; divine Oracles on the Church: who inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would take vpon them, to iudge and condemn the whole Catholique Church; and who, vnder pretext of Reformation, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed almoſt all that is ſacred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Church; barbarouſly deſtroying many excellent Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Sacrilegiouſly vſurping and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the riches &amp; Ornaments of them. This Luther and Calvin did, at the beginning, and this you have compleated in a great meaſure, above all their progenie. Fourthly, you are alſo very guilty of Vſurpation, over the Civil Magiſtrate. The late riſeing of your religion cannot furnish vs old hiſtories: but for your short time, you have been prettie buſſie, and afford vs a good ſtore. For, in our Countrey, there have been only 3. or 4. Princes, ſince your religion Began, and none of them has been exempt from your Vſurpation. Firſt, The Queen Regent was depoſed by you, from her Regency, and died shortly thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for grief. Secondly, How you vſed her daughter, Queen <hi>Mary Stewart,</hi> it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known to the world: For, after you
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:43743:228"/> had impriſonned her, &amp; enforced her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her Crowne; you never deſiſted; till, by perſecuting of her vnto death, you made her purchaſe a more glorious Crown, and yet, by your calumnies, after her death, augment her glory in heaven. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Baſili. con. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</note> How you Vſurped over King Iames her Son, he himſelf hath regiſtred, to your no ſmall infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And albeit you did not prevaile againſt him; yet, you have payed home that defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency with Vſury, to his Son the late King Charles. By this may be ſeen, whither the Pope or yow do Vſurp more, over the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Laſtly, you have been great Vſurpers over mens Conſciences, as may be known (to paſſe by all other inſtances) by your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vrgeing this ſame Covenant, vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proteſtants, againſt their Conſciences: for which, they give you the Title of <hi>Soule-Tyrants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which, may be ſeen, that you are very guilty of the ſame Vſurpations, which you falſly obiect to others.</p>

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</note> for they made ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, vpon indifferent things; as to abſtaine from things ſtrangled, and from blood; giving them out in the name of the holy Ghoſt, and commanding them to be kept by the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:43743:229"/> which Lawes, albeit they reſtrain'd li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; yet they were not againſt Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts principally in three things, to witt, in freedome from the ſlavery of ſin: in freedome from the fear &amp; ſervitude of the Moral Law, by receiving the gift of <hi>Charity,</hi> through Chriſts grace, whereby we willingly and ioyfully-fullfill the Law: and laſtly, in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the bondage of the Iewish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, which S. Peter calls a <hi>heavie yoak.</hi> Theſe are the liberties, wherewith Chriſt has made vs free (as was shown me, at more length) and are not, as the Covenanters do imagine, a libertie to do, what every man liſts, or to be vnder no obedience of Spiritual, or Temporal Lawes. Againſt which licentious libertie S. Peter gives warning, in theſe words: <hi>Be ſubiect vnto every humane Creature, for God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.</note> &amp;c. <hi>as free, and not as having freedome, for a cloke of malice.</hi> And S. Paul to the Galatians: <hi>You are called brethren into libertie:</hi>

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13.</note> 
                  <hi>only make not this libertie an occaſion to the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. Now all the Lawes of the Catholique Church, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainſt which the Miniſters make heavieſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, as about lentfaſting, abſtinence from flesh on frydayes, the ſingle life of Church men, and the like, may be eaſily shown to have been obſerved, in the primitive times, to be moſt iuſt, nowayes Tyrannous, or againſt our Chriſtian libertie; but that they rather tend vnto Chriſtian perfection, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt libertie of a Chriſtian: and that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who ſpeak ſo much againſt theſe holy
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:43743:230"/> Lawes, make their libertie [as S. Paul ſpeaks] an occaſion to the flesh, or as S. Peter ſaith, a cloke of malice.</p>
               <p>But it would indeed ſeem very ſtrange, if it were not ſo ordinary among you, that your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do ſuch things, without all authority, which you blame in the Catholique Church, vnto which Chriſt has given ſo great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For have not you, dureing the ſpace of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me few years, heaped vp more Lawes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in your Aſſemblies, then exceed all the body of the Canon Law? And yet you cannot deny, but the moſt part of theſe Lawes is made vpon indifferent things, and ſome of them, in the Iudgment of many Proteſtants, vpon falſe things: as your Lawes for ſwearing &amp; ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Covenant. You pretend much Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie, which you promiſed to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but indeed you kept them in more then Iewish ſlaverie. For, to paſſe by many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, you would not ſuffer the people, vpon Sundayes, after they had been much wearied, hearing both your long ſome Sermons &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to be ſeen on the ſtreets, or to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat themſelves in the fields: which truly was greater then a Iudaïcal ſervitude. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques find the yoak of Chriſt ſweet, and the Lawes of his Church, their loving Mother, not heavie. But many Proteſtants find the yoak of your Preſbytery, which they eſteem a cruel ſtep-mother, to be very bitter, and think your Lawes, not only againſt their Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but alſo inſupportable.</p>

               <p>Now, we come to your other heavy accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Catholique Church, which, for brevities ſake, we muſt only touch. Yow accuſe her doctrin, as Erroneous, againſt the ſufficiency of the written word. But without all reaſon. For she teacheth, that the written word is ſufficient in this ſenſe, that it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes immediatly the ſubſtance of our faith, all the articles neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate medij,</hi> for mans Salvation: and alſo it containes mediatly, all, that we are to beleeve, in that it remits vs to the Church, which it aſſureth vs, is governed by the holy Ghoſt in all truth, Whence it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently followeth, that we draw that truth out of the ſcriptures, which we draw out of the mouth of the Church: for, whoſoever depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes an other to ſpeak for him, ſpeaks mediatly by his mouth. So S. Auguſtin reaſoneth;<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cont. Creſ. c. <hi>33.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Albeit</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we can produce no example of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, concerning this matter, yet hold we the truth of the ſame Scripture, ſeing we do that, which is conformable to the Vniverſal Church, which the authority of the ſame Scripture commends vnto vs.</hi> And in this ſenſe, the written word is moſt ſufficient. But it is not ſufficient in the common ſenſe of heretiques, who will have the dead letter of the Scripture, to be ſufficient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having recourſe to the Catholique Church for the true ſenſe of it: and who will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be beleeved, but what is formally &amp; expreſly containd in it. For that is directly againſt the Scriptures themſelvs, which refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vs to the Church, and bid vs <hi>ſtand faſt, and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:43743:231"/> hold the Traditions:</hi> That is alſo againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the auncient Fathers. S. Chryſoſtome ſaith:<note place="margin">Chryſ. on <hi>2.</hi> Theſſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>It is evident, that the Apoſtles did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver all things by writing, but many things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and thoſe be as worthy credit, as the others.</hi> Epiphanius ſaith to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>We muſt vſe Traditions:</hi>

                  <hi>for the Scriptures have not all things.</hi> That is contrary to the practice of the Covenanters, who beleeve ſomethings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture, and diverſe points againſt it: as we have ſeen above.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, it has furnished weapons to the Socinians and Anabaptiſts, to fight againſt the Preſbyterians, who now by experience, are become more wiſe, then at the beginning. For in their new Confeſſion of faith, at Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,<note place="margin">Confeſſ. Weſt. <hi>6.1.</hi> art. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> they ſay: <hi>That the whole Counſel of God, concerning all things neceſſary to Salvation, is either expreſly ſet down in Scripture, or, by good and neceſſary conſequence, may be deduced from Scripture.</hi> So that the Scripture, which was before ſufficient, without Church and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, is now not ſufficient to Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Logique and Conſequences: which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin makes them fall into another groſſe folly, to quite the Church, the pillar and ground of Truth, and have recourſe to Philoſophie and fallible conſequences; wherein theſe new ſects are not behind with them, but by the ſame principle, do vndermine them.</p>
               <p>You next accuſe the Catholique Church of erroneous doctrin, againſt the <hi>perfection of the Law, the office of Chriſt and of his Evangel:</hi> But
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:43743:231"/> you do not make good your accuſations: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther show yow, wherein theſe pretended Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors do conſiſt. Yet it may be eaſily shown, that your accuſations are falſe, and that your ſelves are guilty of the ſame crimes. For the Catholique Church teacheth, that the Law of Chriſt is moſt perfect, and that the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of perfection conſiſts in keeping it, and that none can be perfect, without fulfilling it. And albeit it be true, that she teacheth, there be ſome Evangelical Counſels, which make a man more perfect, then the preciſe keeping of the Law: yet that doctrin is nothing againſt the perfection of the Law. For this, was the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſt, of S. Paul, and of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Our Saviour, having ſaid to the young man in the Goſpel. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Aug. epiſt. <hi>89.</hi> ad Hila.</note> 
                  <hi>from this more excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: For there he ſaid: If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments: and here: if thou wilt be perfect, ſell all.</hi> By which, it may appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that the doctrin of the Catholique Church in this matter, being the ſame that Chriſt, his bleſſed Apoſtle, &amp; the holy Fathers taught, is not againſt the perfection of the Law. And the ſame may be made good alſo by the light
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:43743:232"/> of reaſon. For every thing is perfect, when it has perfection in its own degre: and ſo the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church teacheth, that the Law of Chriſt is moſt perfect in the nature of a Law, that no Law can be more perfect; and that perfection conſiſts eſſentially in keeping it. Which nowayes hinders, but that there may be ſome works not commanded, but Counſeled, which may be prefer'd in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſome works commanded, and ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Counſels may be called more perfect, then the Commandments, which are about the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me matter. As for example: it is more perfect to ſell all for the Love of God, which is only a Counſel, then not to ſteal, which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: As it is alſo more perfect, to keep chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then to marie, and not commit adulterie. Again, there are ſome Counſels more perfect, then any of the Commandments, not in regard of the external work, but of the internal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which they preſuppoſe, and to which they lead. For it preſuppoſeth a greater degree of perfection &amp; charity, to renounce all riches &amp; pleaſures, which are otherwiſe lawfull, for the Love of God; then to equal and prefer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God, which is commanded. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Catholique Church is free of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous doctrin, againſt the perfection of the Law; ſo we may iuſtly inferre, that your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, which teacheth, the Law is impoſſible to be kept, is moſt erroneous againſt the very end, and perfection of the Law; ſince it was made for that end to be kept: and it robs men
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:43743:232"/> alſo of all perfection, which cannot be had without keeping the Law.</p>
               <p>Then, for your other accuſations about the office of Chriſt &amp; the Evangel; albeit you ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve by ſuch words, to affright the people: mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them beleeve, that the Pope &amp; the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church are ſworn Enemies to Chriſt &amp; his Goſpel; yet it is well enough known, that Chriſt and his Goſpel are more honoured in the Catholique Church, then among all the ſects of the world. For it is by her means, the Goſpel has been preſerved, and Chriſts name has been honoured among all Nations, all wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich she alone has converted to the faith. But you are enemies to all Chriſts offices. For you would deſtroy his <hi>Kirgly</hi> office, by making him a king many hundred years, without a kingdome, and, by deſtroying the ſpirituel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement thereof; bringing in place of it, the Anarchy &amp; confuſion of your Presſbytery. You are Enemies alſo to his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> office, by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the dayly Sacrifice; for the continuance of which, he is called a Prieſt for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> You are Enemies lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to his Prophetical office: For whereas he had Propheſied ſo clearly of the perpetuity of his Church, that it cannot be hid, that it should be ever governed by the Spirit of truth into all truth: You would make him a falſe Prophet, by teaching that the Church had failed, had been many hundred years inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and was fallen into Anti-Chriſtian Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Laſtly, albeit you pretend to honour the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:43743:233"/> Goſpel, and make it the only rule of your faith; yet you do iuſt the contrary: becauſe you deny what it affirmes, and beleeve the contrary to what it teacheth in expreſſe tearmes, and you make it ſuch a Rule, that you frequently oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe your Iudgments to it, as has been more then once shown.</p>

                  </gap>oſeth the moſt poyſoned ſource of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all their corruptions. The Catholique Church teacheth principally three things in this matter, againſt the Errors of the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:43743:233"/> Firſt, that all Children, as well of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as of infidel parents, deſcending from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam by natural generation, do contract Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, and are borne in it: which is againſt a corrupt doctrin of Calvin, who affirmeth, that the Children of the faithfull are borne Saints. Secondly, the Catholiques teach, that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin is quite taken away and purged in the Sacrament of Baptiſme: which is againſt an other corruption of Calvin and his followers, who affirme, that Original ſin ſtill remaineth in vs, even after Baptiſme. Thirdly, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Doctors ordinarly teach, that Original ſin is nothing elſe; but a privation of original iuſtice or iuſtifying grace, which was in the Superior part of the ſoule, which is reſtored to vs by the merits of Chriſt in the Sacrament of Baptiſme: which is againſt a moſt corrupt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of all Calviniſts, who affirme, that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin is nothing elſe, but <hi>concupiſcence, or a pravitie of Nature, by which the Image of God is vtterly defaced in man, and by which Adam &amp; his poſterity became Enemies to God, ſlaves to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, ſervants to ſin.</hi> So do our Scottish Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſpeak in their firſt Confeſſion, article 3. Of the firſt two points, ſomething hath been ſaid above; and they are both evidently true by the Scriptures &amp; Fathers. For the Apoſtle S. Paul ſaith, that <hi>all ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d in Adam</hi> and <hi>were borne the children of wrath.</hi>

Auguſtin affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that holy Parents <hi>do not beget regenerated Children,</hi> which is ſeconded by <hi>S. Hierom,</hi> who ſaith: <hi>Chriſtiani non naſcuntur, ſed fiunt. We are
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:43743:234"/> not borne but made Chriſtians.</hi> And that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm taketh away Original ſin, has been ſo clearly above shewed, that nothing shall be here repeated; except only what S. Auguſtin ſaid; <hi>None, except an Infidel, can deny it.</hi> The third point alſo was fully cleared to me by the Catholique, who shew, that as all ſin is evil, &amp; evil is nothing elſe, but the privation of good; ſo original ſin being evil, can be nothing elſe, but the privation of ſome good; and that can be of no other good, but of Original Iuſtice. And as Original Iuſtice, albeit it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many ſupernatural perfections, both in the ſoule &amp; body, conſiſted principally &amp; proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that Iuſtifying grace, by which the ſoule was adorned, and Vnited vnto God the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign good; ſo original ſin, is the privation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that Iuſtifying grace, in the Superiour part of the ſoule; the want of which makes the ſoule deformed and averted from God. And ſeing this want is taken away by Baptiſme, and the whole grace, as it beautifyed the ſoule, is entirly reſtored: the whole guilt of original ſin is taken away, and the whole eſſence of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Iuſtice is recovered again, by the merits of Chriſt. Then for Concupiſcence, which is left after Baptiſme, it is not truly any ſin, but a weakneſſe &amp; imperfection of Nature, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the former Original ſin, as all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, miſeries and death it ſelf are. All which are left in vs, even after the ſin it ſelf is taken away, to put vs in mind from what happy Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te we had fallen, and to ſtirre vs vp to labour
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:43743:234"/> more diligently, and to call more earneſtly, for the help of Gods grace. Neither is the grace, which we receive from Chriſt, the ſmaller or weaker, that it doth not take away concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and reſtore vs to the whole rectitude, which Adam enieyed: but it is rather more ſtrong, ſince many by it do ſtand even with all that weakneſſe of nature; which Adam did not with all the grace he had, even in the ſtrength &amp; rectitude of his nature. All which things were confirmed to me by diverſe authorities &amp; reaſons, which were too longſome here to inſert. It shall be ſufficient to bring one teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of S. Auguſtin againſt Calvins opinion and the fundament of it. <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi>

               <p>As then, the Catholique doctrine, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Original ſin, is the ſame holy &amp; pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Primitive Church; ſo your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ô Covenanters, is full of corruptions.

And laſtly, it is the ſource of many corrupt errors; as of your Iuſtification by faith only, the impoſſibility of keeping Gods commandments, the denyall of all good works, of inherent Iuſtice, &amp; many more. From which it is evident, that your doctrine is very much corrupted, which is the cauſe of ſo many corruptions.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo may be eaſily ſeen, that the Catholique doctrin, concerning our natural inhability and rebellion to Gods Law, is not corrupted; becauſe as it teacheth, againſt the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:43743:235"/> that we are vnable, by the power of nature, to keep Gods Law: ſo it affirmeth alſo, againſt the Preſbyterians, what is impoſſible to be done by nature, is poſſible by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: and what we cannot do of our ſelves, we can performe by the ſtrength of him, who comforts vs. Which might be eaſily shown to be S.

But your doctrine is very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, which ſo grants a natural inhability, that it denys all ſupernatural ability, even with the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, to keep his Law. You profeſſe yourſelves to be ſo naturally rebels to God; that all his grace cannot make you good ſubiects: which shewes, that both your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin &amp; your ſelves are very much corrupted. The ſame may be shewed of Sanctification. For the Catholiques teach: that no man is ſo perfectly holy here in this pilgrinage, but he may every day advance in holyneſſe, and be renewed dayly in the inward man: and that no perſon, even the holyeſt, is free of venial ſins &amp; imperfections: and then only we shall be perfect, when this corruption shall put on immortality. In this ſenſe, they grant, that ſanctification in this life is imperfect: whereas in an other ſenſe, they teach, that there may be, even in this life, a certain perfection of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, in ſome degree ſvitable to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the divine Commandments, as has been shewed above, chap. 14. p. 145. But your doctrin is very corrupt, which maks your ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification ſo imperfect, that you cannot, by
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:43743:236"/> it, think ſo much as a good thought, or do any thing, but ſin mortally. And your obedience to the Law is ſo imperfect, that you break it, at every minut; So that ſuch ſanctification may be rather called profanation; and ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to Gods Law, may be iuſtly tearmed Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the Catholique doctrin, which affirmeth; that man is not iuſtifyed by faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be corrupted: then the Scripture is corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, which teacheth the ſame, not only in ſubſtance, but in expreſſe words; proving it by diverſe arguments &amp; examples, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parcing thoſe, who beleeve the contrary, to Devils; as we have ſeen above, chap. 15. pag. 157. But your doctrin, in this principal article of your faith, is very much corrupted which corrupteth the pure fountain of Gods word.</p>
               <p>By all which, may be ſeen, not only, how falſly you accuſe the Catholique doctrin of corruptions, in all the former points; but alſo how truly your own doctrin is full of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions.</p>

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:43743:237"/> in all theſe points. Which shall be brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly shown.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you accuſe the Catholique Church of corrupted doctrin, concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Sacraments: which muſt be, becauſe she teacheth, that the Sacraments of the new law do conferre grace. But we have ſeen above, that this is moſt true doctrin, conforme to the Scriptures and holy Fathers, and that this is a perfection, moſt ſuitable to the excellency of the Chriſtian Sacraments. Whereas your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which robs the Sacraments of all power to conferre Grace, and makes them only ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tokens, ſigns, and ſeals, without all effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and which equals the Sacraments of the old Law in excellency vnto them, corrupts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the nature of the Chriſtian Sacraments, and abaſeth the power of them; which cannot be done, without perverting and corrupting the Scriptures and holy Fathers: which are ſo clear for the Catholique doctrine, that they have moved many famous Proteſtants, to abandon your Calviniſtical opinion. All wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich may be ſeen in the 18. Chapter of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Next, you accuſe the Catholique doctrine of corruption, concerning the <hi>Number</hi> of the Chriſtian Sacraments, whereas indeed, your doctrine, if we will iudge of it by your firſt Reformers, is not only full of corruption, but alſo of confuſion in this matter. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques do conſtantly teach, that there be 7. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Law of grace, inſtituted by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus-Chriſt;

               <p>By which few Teſtimonies, theſe 5. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which you reiect, are as clearly proved out of the Scripture, as theſe two which you admit. Yea, although they had not been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture; yet they are all, with
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:43743:239"/> reverence to be received, ſeing they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by divine Tradition, which is of no leſſe infallible authority, then the Scripture it ſelf, as has been proved above; and this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is evident, both by the conſent of the holy Fathers, and by the conſtant beleef &amp; practice of the whole Church, which has vſed theſe Sacraments in all ages, according to the ends for which they were inſtituted. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Catholique doctrine concerning the number of the Sacraments, which flowes from ſuch pure fountains, is pure &amp; true, &amp; not corrupted, as you do calumniate. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas indeed, your doctrine, and that of your firſt Reformers in this matter, is not only full of corruption, but alſo of confuſion. For Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers followers admit three Sacraments, to witt:<note place="margin">Ap. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. in Man. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>

Wherein you are not behind with them, ſwarving from the doctrin of your Maſter Calvin; and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your own imaginations, admitting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 2. Sacraments; which two alſo in effect you deſtroy, by robbing them of all vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, as has been shewed above, chap. 21. in fine.</p>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:43743:239"/>
               <p>You accuſe next the Catholique Church of corruptions, concerning the vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But it is ſufficient againſt your accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that theſe vſes of the Sacraments, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich you moſt blame: as <hi>private Baptiſm, priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Communion,</hi> &amp;c. are known to have been obſerved by the holy Primitive Church; are in themſelvs laudable; and tend much to the devotion &amp; comfort of the faithfull; and are alſo approved by diverſe learned &amp; moderate Proteſtants. Whereas your doctrines &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes make your Sacraments altogether grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and almoſt Vſeleſſe and Comfortleſſe; for which you are blamed by diverſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
               <p>Moreover, you are enemies alſo to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> with which the Sacraments are adminiſtrated in the Catholique Church. It is not ſufficient for you, to have taken away the fruite of <hi>Grace</hi> from theſe heavenly Trees, planted by God in the Garden of his Church, as in a heavenly Paradiſe; vnleſſe you pull away alſo the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which ſerve, as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves and Ornaments to them. You deteſt all Ceremonies not contain'd in the word of God: By which you lay down a moſt falſe &amp; deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full principle, as if no Ceremonies were to be vſed, which were not expreſly there. For firſt, the Scriptures containes not expreſly all doctrines, but referres vs to the Church and to Traditions, as we have ſeen above. How much leſſe then doth it contain all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? Secondly, As our Saviour, when he did
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:43743:240"/> inſtitute the Sacraments, did not preſcribe the particular forme, by which they should be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, but left that to the wiſdome of his Apoſtles; ſo his Apoſtles did not ſet down that manner in writing S. Auguſtin expreſly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes the firſt part,<note place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>118.</hi> ad Ianuar.</note> ſaying: <hi>Chriſt did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in what order thereafter, the Sacrament should be taken, that he might leave that place to the Apoſtles, by whom hs was to order his Church.</hi> The ſecond part is alſo evident. For we never read, where S. Paul, (who writing to the Corinthians, concerning the holy Euchariſt, ſaid:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>11.</hi> ver. vlt.</note> 
                  <hi>The reſt I will diſpoſe, when</hi> I <hi>come</hi>) did expreſſe that manner or order in the Scripture. And the ſame may be ſaid of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Thirdly, Some Rites and Ceremonies vſed by Chriſt himſelf, &amp; recorded in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, were changed by the holy Apoſtles, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt, for the greater honour of the bleſſed Sacrament; and have been from the Apoſtles times obſerved, throughout the whole Church, without Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.<note place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>118.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> This S. Auguſtin doth teſtify. <hi>Neither</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe Chriſt gave the Sacrament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meat, ought we, having dyn'd or ſup't, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to receive that Sacrament; or as theſe, whom the Apoſtle reproves and corrects, mingle it with their Tables, &amp;c. For it ſeem'd good to the holy Ghoſt, that, for the honour of ſo great a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, our Lords body, before all other meat, should firſt enter into the mouth of a Chriſtian: and therefore this cuſtom is obſerved throughout the whole world.</hi> Fourthly, the Church can
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:43743:240"/> inſtitute ceremonies for greater decency and Order, and for the more honour of God. For, if Iacob a private man vſed a new Ceremonie, by erecting a ſtone, by powring oyle vpon it, and giving it the title of <hi>Bethel:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 28.</note> If the Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of the Iewes made a new feaſt, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Mardocheus:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſter.</hi> 9.</note> why not alſo shall the Church of Chriſt have the ſame authority? If ſuch was the power of a private man, and of the <hi>Handmaid;</hi> How much more ought the power be of the <hi>Free-woman,</hi> the holy Church the immaculate Spouſe of Ieſus-Chriſt? Or what can be more ridiculous and profane, then to grant that power to theſe, and deny it to this. Or to think, that the Catholique Church which is governed by the Holy Ghoſt, in all truth, according to Chriſts promiſe, should not have ſo much wiſdom, as to ordain aright ſome few Ceremonies?</p>
               <p>Therefore, your former principle is very falſe, for many reaſons; yea, it is ſo falſe, that yourſelves doe not obſerve it. For, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve you Scripture for the Godfathers &amp; God-Mothers, which you require at Baptiſm? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re have you ſcripture, for taking your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion faſting, from the hands of one another, &amp; not from the hands of your Miniſter, and for many ſuch rites &amp; cuſtomes, beſides your ſtoole of Repentance? When did your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters obſerve that ceremony of washing the feet of others, which was vſed by Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13.5.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the celebration of the Euchariſt? When did either they, or their Elders anoint the ſick,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:43743:241"/> according to S. Iames precept. Whereby it is evident, that you obſerve ſome Rites, which are not contain'd in the ſcriptures; and others you neglect, which are there particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended.</p>
               <p>As then it is clear, that the Church of Chriſt may vſe ceremonies, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Scripture; ſo theſe Ceremonies, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich she obſerveth, are moſt commendable: becauſe they are moſt auncient, and were vſed in the primitive times, as <hi>Coccius</hi> shewes by the teſtimonies of the holy Fathers: they are moſt obſerveable: becauſe they were inſtituted by the holy Apoſtles and Paſtors of the Church, who had both authority and wiſdom, to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute thoſe, which are moſt convenient; And laſtly they have been confirmed, by the long practice of the whole Church, againſt whoſe cuſtome to diſpute, as S. Auguſtin affirmes, is moſt inſolent madneſſe. Therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or rather againſt all reaſon, do you deteſt the Ceremonies of the Catholique Church. No religion can be without Ceremonies, and we ſee in the Scripture, that all great myſteries are accompanyed with ſublime &amp; ſignificative Ceremonies, as our Saviours <hi>Nativity, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, Transfiguration, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,</hi> the <hi>Deſcent of the holy Ghoſt</hi> &amp;c. Our ſaviour alſo, at all great &amp; ſolemn actions, vſed many Ceremonies, as at the raiſing of Lazarus, the cureing of the man, who was both deaf &amp; dumb, Mark 7.33. and vpon many other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: all which Ceremonies ſerve as Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:43743:241"/> of religion, preſenting an external Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty to the ſenſes, and making the ſpiritual myſteries to be more clearly vnderſtood, to be received with greater reverence, and to be more deeply imprinted in the hearts of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. The ſame might be eaſily verifyed of the Catholique Ceremonies. Therefore, you, who vnder pretext of ſpirituality, are profeſt Enemies to all Ceremonies, do not take heed, that you take all order &amp; decency from the Church &amp; ſervice of God, that you oppoſe the practice of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, and of the whole Primitive Church; and do render the ſublime myſteries of the Chriſtian religion contemptible.</p>
               <p>You renounce alſo (to vſe your words) the Popes 5. baſtard Sacraments. But that is only proper to adultereſſe Churches, to have ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Sacraments. The Catholique Church has none but lawfull Sacraments, inſtituted by her heavenly Spouſe Ieſus-Chriſt, of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue &amp; grace: as we have ſeen all theſe 5. to be. But indeed you have made even thoſe two, which you keep, baſtard Sacraments, by robbing them of all vertue and grace.</p>
               <p>We shall only ſpeak a word of your other Deteſtations which follow, in this Section; becauſe ſome of them have been touched abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve. Firſt, vnder the name of the Pope, you deteſt, the iudgment of the Catholique Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch, as cruel, againſt infants dying without Baptiſm; and for the abſolute neceſſity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. But this was alſo the iudgment of the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:43743:242"/> Primitive Church, yea of Chriſt himſelf, who has ſaid:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>vnleſſe one be borne again of water &amp; the Spirit, he shall not enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> And therefore is not cruel, as has been shewed above, at more length. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your iudgment is both falſe and cruel againſt many children dying with Baptiſm, excluding them from heaven. Yea not only your Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is cruel, but alſo your practice, ſuffering many children to dye without Baptiſme:<note place="margin">Confer. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton-Court.</note> for which cruelty, King Iames affirmed that your Miniſters, who were guilty of it, would be damned.</p>
               <p>You accuſe next the Catholique Church of blaſphemy, for beleeving the Reall Preſence or Tranſubſtantiation, (which you wiſely make all one queſtion,) and for teaching, that the wicked receive the body of Chriſt. But they are not blaſphemous, who do beleeve Chriſts words expreſſed, by 3. Evangeliſts and one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and who follow the conſtant doctrin of the holy Fathers &amp; of the auncient Church, as the Catholiques do in this matter; as has been shewed above.</p>
               <p>And, if the wicked did not receive the body of Chriſt, how could they be guilty of it, as the Apoſtles affirmes the vnworthy receivers of it to be? But you are rather guilty of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, (even in the iudgment of Proteſtants,) who will not beleeve Chriſts clear words; and deny thereby his Omnipotency. Luther, your firſt Apoſtles gives this Iudgment of you: <hi>We cenſure as heretiques &amp; aliens from the Church
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:43743:242"/> of God, the Zuinglians &amp; all Sacramentaries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luth. cont. Lova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nien. Theſ. <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>who deny the body &amp; blood of Chriſt to be received with the Carnal Mouth, in the Euchariſt.</hi> And a famous Doctor of his Church continues the ſame opinion of you; for, ſpeaking of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me matter, he ſaith: <hi>the ſect of the Calviniſts is grown to ſuch blaſphemy and madneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conrad. Shluſſel. Theol. Calvin l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that they dare call in queſtion Gods omnipotency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then you accuſe the Pope &amp; Catholique Church, for Diſpenſations in ſolemn Oaths and Periuries. But theſe are either vain or falſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations. For it is certain that the Church may diſpenſe ſometimes with the bond of oaths, as she may looſe from punishments, and free men from the bonds of ſins, according to that power, which Chriſt gave to her, ſaying: <hi>whatſoever thou shall looſe on earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 16,</note> 
                  <hi>shall be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. But it muſt be for a iuſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and without the iuſt preiudice of others, as Becan shewes,<note place="margin">Becan de ur. &amp; iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia queſt. <hi>88.</hi> q. <hi>11</hi>
                  </note> or elſe the diſpenſation is not valid. Periuries or falſe oaths need no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, as you miſtake or calumniate; but muſt be only taken away by true Repentance, as other ſins are purged. It is ſtrange, that you should deny the lawfull power of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the whole Catholique Church, ſuch as S. Paul vſed with the inceſtuous Corinthian; and yet appropriate it to every one of your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves: and should obiect that falſly, as a crime to others, whereof yourſelves are ſo deeply guilty. For it is known, how many oaths &amp; vowes your firſt Reformers did either break, or diſpenſe with, at their own hands; and if
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:43743:243"/> we will beleeve King Iames,<note place="margin">Baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron p. <hi>41.</hi>
                  </note> you are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind with any, in theſe enormities.</p>
               <p>You accuſe alſo falſly the Pope &amp; Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church, for diſpenſing in degrees of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, forbidden by the word of God; that is by the Law of Chriſt; vnleſſe you will have the Ceremonial Law of the Iewes, to be the Law of Chriſt, and to oblige all Chriſtians: whence it would follow, that, if a man died without iſſue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deuter.</hi> 25.5.</note> his brother should marie the Widow, which yourſelves do not obſerve, but deny, that it ought to be done. The Church is ſo far from diſpenſing in degrees forbidden by the eternal Law of God, that she has made Lawes, forbidding &amp; diſſolving Mariages, in degrees not prohibited by the Eternal Law of God, which ſerve, as out-works, to guard the divin Law. She diſpenſeth indeed ſometimes, vpon good reaſon, in her own lawes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the eternal Law of God, which she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to be altogether indiſpenſable.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Pope and Catholique Church guilty of cruelty, againſt the innocent divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by forbidding them to marie; vnleſſe Chriſt himſelf, and S. Paul be cruel, and the Primitive Church, which taught the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 16.8.</note> Our Saviour ſaith: <hi>every one, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away his wife, and marieth another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth adulterie, and he, that marieth her, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth adulterie.</hi>

                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:43743:243"/> Whence it is clear, that neither of the parties can marie, ſo long, as the other lives. This was the doctrine of the holy Fathers, and of the ancient Church. S. Auguſtin proveth this in his bookes <hi>de adulterinis coniugijs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>50.</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m liar. hom. <hi>49.</hi>

                  </note> the Catholique Church in denying Mariage to the innocent partie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced, is not cruel, as you calumniate; but obſerves the iuſt Law of Chriſt, the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtle, and the practice of the holy ancient Church. And if any think it hard, they have a remedie preſcribed by the Apoſtle; to reconcile themſelves to the guilty partie. But indeed you are cruel, who, vnder pretext of mercy, do allow men, to Violate the iuſt Law of God: and, vnder the name of Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, authorize people to commit Adulteries, to the deſtruction of their ſoules. So that, it is truly verifyed of you, that your mercies are cruel. But let vs proceed now to your other abiurations.</p>

               <p>AFTER you had robbed Chriſtians, of almoſt all the Sacraments, and of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours legacie, to witt, his precious body; now you would rob the Church, of the Chriſtian Sacrifice, and would ſpoyle God of the greateſt external honour, that can be rendred to him, &amp; is due to him alone.

               <p>As the Prophets foretould ſo Chriſt fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by inſtituting this Sacrifice: by offering it vp himſelf; and by ordaining it to be offered vp vnto the end of the world.

                  <hi>is the high Prieſt of God the Father. He offered vp himſelf a Sacrifice to his Father: and the ſame he commanded to be done in his remembrance.</hi> To which two we shall only adioyn S. Auguſtin, who ſaith:<note place="margin">Aug. in pſal. <hi>33.</hi> ſerm. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt did Inſtitute the Sacrifice of his body &amp; blood, according to the Order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech.</hi> And laſt of all may be added the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the whole Chriſtian world, which in all ages, from the death of Chriſt, did render vnto God ſupreme honour &amp; worship; teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Soveraignity, &amp; power of life &amp; death, by this moſt excellent Sacrifice of Chriſts body &amp; blood, which the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers called the Sacrifice of the Maſſe: The Vertue alſo of which God has manifeſted, by many Miracles, one of which I will recount, out of S. Auguſtin, to our purpoſe.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>22,</hi> de Civit. c. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> Which is briefly thus. The houſe of a certain Tribune in the Countrey, near to <hi>Hippo</hi> the City of S. Auguſtins reſidence, being vexed with evil Spirits, to the great loſſe of his cattel and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of his Servants, <hi>he came and deſired that one of our Prieſts</hi> (ſaith the holy Father) <hi>I being then abſent, would goe and pray, that the Devil might be chaſed away. Wherevpon one went, and offered vp,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the body &amp; blood of Chriſt, to the end that the vexation might ceaſe: and by Gods mercy it did ceaſe immediatly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As therefore it is evident, by what has been briefly ſaid, from the Scriptures &amp; holy Fathers
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:43743:246"/> that there is nothing more holy &amp; divine in the whole Chriſtian religion, then the Chriſtian Sacrifice of Chriſts pretious body &amp; blood, vnder the formes of bread &amp; wine, which was foretould by the Prophets, inſtituted and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by Chriſt himſelf, and was thereafter offered vp by the holy Apoſtles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; ſo you very wickedly call it Devilish: For that cannot be Devilish, which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by God himſelf, and whereby he is moſt honoured; that cannot be Devilish, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich chaſeth away Devils. But your railing againſt it, and abolishing it, muſt be Devilish; becauſe the Devil, by his principal inſtrument, the great Anti-Chriſt, is to abolish it in the later dayes. Daniel 11.31. and Luther your firſt Reformer,<note place="margin">Luth. de Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa pri. tom. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> by a ſtrange divine Providence did confeſſe to the world, that the Devil did ſtirre him vp, by many arguments, to abrogat it. And as the Sacrifice is moſt holy &amp; divine; ſo is the office of Prieſthood, by which it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, moſt ſacred and venerable. If the Aaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Prieſthood, whereby only bullocks and beaſts were Sacrificed to God, was ſo ſacred; how much more ſacred &amp; excellent muſt be the Chriſtian Prieſthood, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchiſedech, by which the body &amp; blood of Chriſt are offered vp vnto God, a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Oblation? And therefore, you very wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call the office of Prieſthood <hi>blaſphemous,</hi> and by dishonouring it, you dishonour God himſelf, who did inſtitute it, as S. Ignatius the Diſciple of the Apoſtles affirmes, when he ſaith: <hi>that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:43743:246"/> Prieſthood is the Top of all Honours,</hi>

                  <hi>that are amongſt men: which if any man dishonoureth, he dishonours God &amp; our Lord Ieſus-Chriſt, the alone chief Prieſt of God, by nature.</hi> Your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial office is rather blaſphemous againſt God, which robs him of his ſupreme worship by Sacrifice, which has been given vnto him, ſince the Creation.</p>
               <p>That the Chriſtian Sacrifice is offered vp for ſins, our Saviour shewes, when he ſaith: <hi>This is my blood, which is shed for many, to the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</hi> And that it is profitable alſo, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, to the faithfull departed, the holy Fathers do teach, by the Scriptures, and practice of the whole Church.<note place="margin">Aug. l. de cura pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis c. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>We deteſt his Canonization of men: calling vpon Angels or Saints departed: worshiping of Images, Reliques &amp; Croſſes; Dedicating of Kirks, Altars, Dayes, and Vowes to Creatures.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>We shall now, for brevities ſake, run ſpeedily through all the reſt of the Covenant. Firſt you blame here the Catholique Church, for a moſt laudable cuſtome, which she has ever obſerved, of Canonizing, that is, declareing ſome perſons, who had been eminent for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, to be glorifyed Saints in heaven. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re have been indeed different wayes, by wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich this Canonization has been performed. For ſometimes it was done by the voice of the people, with conſent of their Prelats, or by the Prelats, the people not controuling: But ſince the year 800. none have been Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but by the Sea Apoſtolique, according to the decree of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the third: Whence it is, that this action is performed with greater diligence, and more exact trial, both of life &amp;
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:43743:247"/> miracles, then when it was done, in a popular manner. What then can you iuſtly blame here? But indeed you are to be blamed, who Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize in your own manner, not Saints, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that break mortaly every day Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? and ſuch was your Covenanting Army, which you ordinarly called the <hi>Army of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You paſſe next, from deteſting the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Canonizing of Saints, to deteſt the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation both of Angels &amp; Saints: But indeed you cannot deteſt that; vnleſſe you deteſt alſo the Scriptures, &amp; the practice of the Saints &amp; of the whole Primitive Church. For did not <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> invocat an Angel, when bleſſing Ioſephs children, he ſaid: <hi>The Angel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 18 16. <hi>Oſee</hi> 12.4.</note> 
                  <hi>which delivered me from all evil, bliſſe theſe children?</hi> Doth not the Prophet Oſee teſtify the ſame, ſaying. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob prevailed agrinſt the Angel, he wept &amp; prayed to him?</hi> Did not alſo <hi>Abraham, Lot, Gedeon</hi> pray to Angels, as may be ſeen recorded in the Scriptures, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 18.4.19.1. Iudges 6.3. Therefore, in deteſting the invocation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, you deteſt the Scriptures &amp; practice of the Saints. The ſame may be alſo ſaid of the Invocation of Saints departed. For, if it be lawfull to invocat the Angels, why not alſo the Saints of Heaven, whom our Saviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes to be <hi>equal vnto the Angels? Luke</hi> 20.36. Yea, if it be lawfull to invocat Saints and ſinners, living vpon earth, and to deſire the aſſiſtance of their prayers: why is it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to invocat the Saints, raigning in Heaven?
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:43743:248"/> and deſire them to pray for vs? To ſay that they do not hear our prayers, and know not what is done here below, which may concern them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10.</note> is moſt falſe: For our Saviour sheweth, that there is <hi>ioy among the Angels of Heaven, at the Converſion of a ſinner.</hi> Therefore, they muſt know it. And shall the Angels know ſuch things, and reioyce at them: and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed Saints, who are of our own nature, be altogether ignorant of them, and have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling with vs? Shall ſome Saints living here on earth know the ſecrets of others hearts, know what is done at a diſtance, as is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Scripture of Samuel, in relation to King Saul 1. Kings 1.19. and of Elizeus in regard of his man Giezi, 4. Kings 5.25. to paſſe by other inſtances of Daniel &amp; S. Peter; shall I ſay theſe Saints have ſuch knowledge in their exile here, on earth: and shall the glorifyed Saints, in their Countrey, in the preſence &amp; fruition of God, be ignorant of ſuch things, and ſo be in a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe condition? No; that cannot be: for that could not ſtand with the goodneſſe of God, &amp; happineſſe of their Eſtate. Yea does not S. Iohn expreſly deliver, that the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do not only know our prayers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apocal.</hi> 5.8.</note> but alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them vp to God, when he ſaith: <hi>that the foure beaſts, and the foure and twentie Elders fel before the Lambe, having every one harpes, and golden Vials full of odours, which are the prayers of the Saints?</hi> Laſtly, what was the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin &amp; practice of the Primitive Church, may be known briefly, by the teſtimonies of the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:43743:248"/> two great lights, S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> The firſt ſaith: <hi>We muſt pray to the Angels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambroſ lib. de viduis.</note> 
                  <hi>who are given to be our defenders, we muſt pray to the Martyrs, &amp;c. For they are able to pray for our ſins, who have washed away their own.</hi> The other, having invocated the bleſſed Virgin, and many Angels &amp; Saints by name, concludes, ſaying:<note place="margin">Aug. Medit. c. <hi>40.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I beſeech you interceed for me a ſinner vnto God, that I may be delivered from the iawes of the Devil, and everlaſting death.</hi> So you may ſee, how vnreaſonably you deteſt ſo holy a doctrine, &amp; ſo profitable a practice, which has been vſed by the greateſt Saints.</p>
               <p>Now we are come to that point, to witt: the worshiping of Images, wherein you pretend great advantage. For firſt you give out, that the Catholique doctrin &amp; practice in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is directly againſt the Scriptures, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly againſt the ſecond Commandment. Secondly, you affirm with great clamours, that the Catholiques prevarication is ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent here, that to conceale the matter from the people, they have taken away the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. And for this cauſe eſpecially you accuſe the Catholiques, and condemn them for Sacrilegious Idolaters. But all theſe were shown me to be vain pretences.</p>
               <p>For firſt it is clear in the old Teſtament, that the ancient Synagogue of the Iewes had their holy Images, and that by Gods own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, that they did alſo reverence and honour them with competent worship. The firſt part is evident Exodus 25. where God
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:43743:249"/> ſaid to Moyſes: <hi>Two Cherubins of beaton gold shalt thou make, on both ſides of the Oracle.</hi> Moyſes did obey this command chap. 37. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover, King Salomon did adorne the famous Temple of Ieruſalem with diverſe pictures, 3. <hi>Kings c.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 28. To ſpeak nothing of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpent, which God gave order to make. Behold here the commandment of God for making &amp; placeing of holy Images, in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, vpon the Ark; notwithſtanding the Iewes were moſt prone to Idolatrie. And that theſe Images were alſo honoured by the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people of the Iewes, is evident. For the Cherubins were the chief part and Ornament of the Ark, and the whole Ark was honoured as may appeare, firſt, becauſe it was put in the Holy of Holys, as in a moſt honorable place, Heb. 9.4. Secondly, it was tranſlated with great honour to the houſe of <hi>Obededom.</hi> Thirdly it was only lawfull to the Prieſts &amp; Levits to carie it. 3. Kings, 5.6. Fourthly, the Philiſtims were punished with diverſe plagues, becauſe they kept it beſide themſelvs without due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and vpon the contrary <hi>Obededom</hi> was bliſſed for keeping it honorably in his houſe. 1. Kings 5.6. and 6.11. Yea God himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the mouth of David,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.</note> ſaying: <hi>Adorato ſcabellum pedum eius. Adore his footſtoole.</hi> This is vnderſtood of the Ark, as appeares by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids words. 1. Chron. 28. v. 2. And what ever it be, it is not God; and yet the Iewes were commanded to adore it, Now can any man, of ſolid iugment and conſideration, think, that
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:43743:249"/> God did prohibite all Images, and veneration of them, by that which the Proteſtants call the ſecond commandment: to witt, <hi>Thou shalt not make any graven Idol:</hi> and yet immediatly thereafter, should command Moyſes to make Images, and to hold them in ſuch Veneration? Or rather is it not evident, that the Proteſtants do apply very falſly, what is ſpoken in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, againſt Idols, to the holy Images of Chriſt &amp; his Saints? Therefore it is evident that, the Iewes had not only holy Images by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which were ſet in their Tabernacle, Temple, and moſt holy places: but alſo that they did lawfully and religiouſly worship and honour them: albeit with an honour infinitly inferiour to that, which is due to God.</p>
               <p>And as the Iewes had their holy Images, ſo with as good, if not more reaſon, had the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians, theirs; which they placed in their Oratories, and reverenced with due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, S. Chryſoſtom ſaith in his Liturgy: <hi>the Prieſt bowes his head vnto the Image of Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Baſ. lib. de Sp. S. c. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> Baſil affirmeth, <hi>that the honour of the Image is referred to the Exemplar.</hi> Many more teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were shown me from the Fathers, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtories, but for brevities ſake I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to cite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as alſo it was shewed,<note place="margin">Concil. <hi>2.</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen.</note> that theſe who were enemies to the holy Images of Chriſt &amp; his Saints, were condemned by the auncient Church, as moſt furious Heretiques, called the <hi>Iconaclaſts;</hi> who concur'd in this impiety, againſt Chriſt &amp; his Saints, with the profeſt Enemies of Chriſt: as Iulian the Apoſtat, the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:43743:250"/> perfidious Iewes, &amp; Mahumetans, deſtroying where euer they could, the Images of Chriſt &amp; his Saints, againſt whom God by many miracles has manifeſted the truth: as he did once againſt the Iewes, by making aboundance of blood to flow from our Saviours Image, which they had pierced &amp; crucifyed, in the Citie of <hi>Bery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi> By which miracle, &amp; by the miraculous cure of the ſick, who were anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that blood, the whole multitude of Iewes in that place was converted,<note place="margin">Athan. lib. de P ſſione Imag. Chriſti c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> as S. Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius teſtifyeth. By which it is evident, (to paſſe by diverſe other Miracles, recorded in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories) that holy Pictures are capable of dishonour, and therefore alſo of competent honour: that Catholiques, by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them &amp; giving due reverence vnto them, follow the practice of the ancient Chriſtians, and Tradition of the Apoſtles; as S. Baſil teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth,<note place="margin">Baſil. ap. Con. Nicen. <hi>2.</hi> act. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> ſaying: <hi>I honour the hiſtories of the Saints Images, and I openly adore them. For this, being delivered by the holy Apoſtles, is not to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; but, in all our Churches, we erect their hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> And it is no leſſe evident, that you, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting Miniſters, who furiouſly break &amp; defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce all holy Pictures &amp; Croſſes, do thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour Chriſt &amp; his Saints; go againſt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ancient Chriſtians, &amp; follow the example of furious heretiques, &amp; of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Enemies of Chriſt. You, without all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, deteſt the Catholiques worshiping of Images; but you ought rather to deteſt your own profaneing of them, which indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:43743:250"/> Proteſtants do deteſt.</p>
               <p>Hence, may be eaſily diſcovered the Vanity of all your former pretenſions; as firſt, when you ſay: that Images are forbidden to be made &amp; worshiped, by that, which you call the ſecond Commandment. For there are only forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Idols, and all divine worship to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but not the holy Images of Chriſt &amp; his Saints; nor a competent worship due vnto them. Did not God himſelf, in the ſame book, command the holy Images of Cherubins to be made, and due Veneration to be given vnto them? <hi>Adore you his foot-ſtoole,</hi> &amp;c. Is God contrary to himſelf; or will he command Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? Secondly, you falſly alleadge, that the Catholiques take away the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby you deceive many: For they make only that, a part of the firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you make the ſecond: and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein they follow the authority of S. Auguſtin, who expreſly ſaith;<note place="margin">Aug. q. <hi>71.</hi> ſup. Exod.</note> 
                  <hi>that more conveniently three precepts of the firſt Table are to be reckoned, then foure,</hi> and that theſe words, <hi>Thou shalt not make any Idol,</hi> are indeed an explication of the former. Which diviſion of the commandments was alſo shown to me, to be moſt agreeable to right reaſon. Thirdly, you falſly calumniate the Catholiques for Idolaters: ſeing they do not worship holy Images, as Gods, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship: but with a reſpect infinitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that, like vnto the honour, which the people of God gave vnto the Arke, and the Cherubins; and which is given by all good
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:43743:251"/> Chriſtians to the letters of the holy Scriptures. But indeed all theſe accuſations, which you bring falſly againſt others, may be iuſtly retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt your ſelves: For, though you adore no Idols made with hands; yet you adore many Errors &amp; fancies of your own braines, which S. Hierom calls the Idols of Heretiques. And you have not taken away only one, but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, all Gods commandments, by denying the poſſibility of keeping them.</p>
               <p>What has been ſaid of holy Images, may alſo be vnderſtood of Croſſes. Then, for Reliques, the Scripture, Fathers, and right reaſon are ſo clear, for dutifull reſpect &amp; veneration to be given vnto them, that there can be no doubt of it. Do we not read in the Scripture, how the woman in the Goſpel, by touching reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctfully the hem of our Saviours garment, was cured of her bloody flux? <hi>Math.</hi> 9.21. How S. Iohn Baptiſt did ſo reſpect &amp; honour the latchet of our Saviours shoe, that he eſteem'd himſelf vnworthy to vntye it? <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.7. How the <hi>Napkins, that had but touched the body of S. Paul, caſt out Devils, and cured diſeaſes?</hi> Acts 19.12. How the ancient Church did reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce Reliques,<note place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>103.</hi>
                  </note> S. Auguſtin teſtifyeth, ſaying. <hi>They bring the Reliques of moſt bleſſed Stephen the Martyr, which your Holyneſſe is not ignorant, as we alſo have done, how conveniently you ought to honour.</hi> And, in his 22. book of the Citie of God, he ſayes: <hi>At the Reliques of S. Stephen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there were, in a short ſpace, ſo many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought, that they might fill many Volumes.</hi>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:43743:251"/> It is alſo agreeable to right reaſon, to honour Reliques: For the very light of Nature teaches vs, to honour the Inſtruments of ſupernatural effects, and to carie due reſpect vnto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints. But theſe, who dishonour and deſtroy them, imitat the old Pagans, and the enemies of the Chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>You accuſe laſtly, in this place, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, for dedicating Churches, Altars, Dayes &amp; Vowes to Creatures. But it is ſufficient ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainſt your accuſations, to know, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the cuſtome of the holy Fathers &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians, who dedicated Churches, Altars, &amp;c. not to Creatures, but to God the Creator, albeit in memorie of the Saints &amp; Martyrs. So S. Auguſtin ſaith:<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>20</hi> cont Fauſt. c. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Chriſtian people celebrateth the memories of Martyrs, with fuligious ſolemnity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but yet ſo, that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>want Altars to none of the Martyrs, but vnto the God of Martyrs, though in memorie of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi> The ſame he affirmeth of Churches, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>We build not Churches vnto our Martyrs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. lib <hi>22.</hi> de Civ. c. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>as vnto God, but Memories, as vnto dead men, whoſe Spirits live with God.</hi> Then, for Dayes, they are principally dedicated vnto God, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough in honour and memorie of the Saints. As alſo, Vowes are properly &amp; principally made to God, as vnto the firſt Principle &amp; Author of all good; but when they are made to the Saints, they are made in a ſecondary manner, as vnto the Friends of God, by whoſe prayers &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion we receive benefits from him; wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich is a reſpect infinitly inferiour to that, which
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:43743:252"/> is given by vowing to God, as may be ſeen in <hi>Bellarmin</hi> lib. 3. <hi>de cultu Sanctor.</hi> c. 11. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you are iuſtly to be blamed, who dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate no Churches nor Altars to God; but have deſtroyed &amp; profaned many, that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to his ſervice; and have abolished the feſtival dayes, not only of the Saints, but of Chriſt himſelf; and are ſo far from honouring the Saints, (whom you call very ſimply Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) with Vowes, that you have taken away that worship &amp; reſpect from God the Creator, which had been alwayes given to him; both in the Law of Moyſes, &amp; in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <hi>Neither could it be truly ſaid of ſome, That they are neither forgiven in this life, nor in the life to come, vnleſſe there were ſome, who, though they are not forgiven in this life, yet should be,</hi>

                  <hi>in the life to come.</hi> S. Bernard brings this ſame teſtimony, by which alone he thinks, to have ſufficiently confuted the Petro-bruſian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, who denyed Purgatory in his time. The third place is Math. 5.26.27. where our Saviour ſaith: <hi>Amen, I ſay to thee, thou shalt not goe out from thence, till thou pay the laſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Vpon which S. Hierom. <hi>This is that which he ſaith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieron. in c. <hi>5.</hi> Math.</note> 
                  <hi>thou shalt not go out of priſon, till thou shalt pay even thy little ſins.</hi> By all which, it is evident, that Purgatory was beleeved by the holy Fathers &amp; by the Primitive Church, and that it has good ground in the Scriptures. Yea the ſame was alſo beleeved by the ancient Iewes, as it is clear out of the 2. book of the Machabees, 12. ch. and it is alſo known, that the Iewes, to this day, pray for the dead: to ſpeak nothing, that the very Heathens of old held, and the Mahumetans hold the ſame,<note place="margin">Bellar. l. <hi>1.</hi> de purg. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> as Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min sheweth. Therefore, it is not only a falſe, but alſo a shameleſſe calumnie, which you Covenanting Miniſters do make, when you ſay, that Purgatory is a late invention of the Popes; and they are miſerably deceived, who
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:43743:253"/> give credit to you. But indeed you ought not to be ſo great enemies to Purgatory; ſeing you muſt either grant a certain Purgatory, after this life, or elſe none of you can go to Heaven: as has been shewed above out of your own principles. For, ſeing according to your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Supra p. <hi>188.</hi>
                  </note> the filthineſſe of your ſins alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in you, dureing this life, it muſt either be taken away &amp; purged after this life, and ſo conſequently you muſt grant a Purgatory; or elſe you will not be admitted into that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City, where no vnclean thing can enter.</p>
               <p>Purgatory then being ſo firmly eſtablished by the the Scriptures, Fathers, &amp; Tradition of the whole Church, the queſtion of Prayer for the dead, which has ſuch affinity with it, is ſoone determined. <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtins teſtimony alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne shall be ſufficient, becauſe it shewes the practice of the whole ancient Church.<note place="margin">Aug. de Verbis Apost. ſer. <hi>34.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>It is not to be doubted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but the dead are eaſed by the prayers of the holy Church, by the wholſome Sacrifice, and the almes, which are given for the ſoules departed; ſo that they are more mercyfully</hi> dealt with, by our Lord, then their ſins do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. For <hi>this being</hi> delivered <hi>by the Fathers, the whole Church obſerveth.</hi> And that this was not a new doctrine or practice, Calvin himſelf confeſſeth, granting, that it was a cuſtome to pray for the dead, 13. hundred years, before his time. Cal. l. 3. inſt. c. 5. par. 10.</p>
               <p>You deteſt next the cuſtome of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, in offering vp her publique pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers in a language not vulgaire. But you do
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:43743:254"/> this without ſolid reaſon. For firſt the Church has introduced no Novelty in that matter; but has ſtill retain'd her Liturgies in the ſame Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, which she had vſed from the firſt time of her founding, by the holy Apoſtles. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Church has thought more fitting, to retain her Liturgies in theſe ancient, ſacred, and vnchangeable languages, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly now known; then to ſubiect her Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies to all the inconveniences, that are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the changes of vulgaire tongues, which are in a continual ebbing &amp; flowing. This cuſtome may be confirmed by the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the ancient Iewes, who having corrupted their language, by the long continuance of the Babylonicall captivity, ſpeaking commonly Syraick, did not leave of for that, to continew their office in the Hebrew tongue: for which our Saviour did not reprehend them, which certainly he had done, if it had been an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing. Thirdly, The command and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church ought to be obeyed and followed, in matters of diſciplin, where God has commanded nothing, as he has done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here, concerning the language of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Liturgie. Laſtly, there is no neceſſitie of vſeing a vulgaire tongue, in the publique prayers of the Church; ſeing they are directed to God (who vnderſtands all languages) for the good of the people, who are ſufficiently inſtructed in theſe matters, by continual Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing, preaching, and interpretation, in their vulgaire languages. And hence it comes
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:43743:254"/> to paſſe, that the ſervice of the Church is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re venerable, being in an ancient, vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble language, not known to all: and by that means alſo, the Communion of the Churches ſervice is more ſpread, it being in a Common language. Therefore, we may iuſtly conclude, that you vniuſtly blame the Catholique Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch, for vſeing this ancient &amp; venerable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. But you may be iuſtly blamed, who, although you pray not in a ſtrange language, yet, you oftentimes pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> in a ſtrange ſenſe, yea, you have committed a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abſurditie: For you have put Latin, which you call a ſtrange language, in your Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, this ſame very Covenant, when you abiure <hi>opus operatum:</hi> as we shall ſee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: and, which is more, you do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, and explain it, which, experience she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, none or few of you can doe. If it be amiſſe (as you alleadge) to pray vnto God in a ſtrange language, albeit he vnderſtands all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: it is much more faulty in you, to put Latine in your Confeſſion of faith, which the people does not vnderſtand: and yet not only require them to ſay, but alſo enforce them to ſwear <hi>Amen</hi> to it: as you have done with your Covenant: Vnleſſe perhaps, you think it a ſin, to pray vnto God in a ſtrange language, but not to ſwear, or curſe ſomething in it.</p>
               <p>You are Enemies alſo to the moſt laudable Ceremonies and devotions of the Catholique Church; as vnto Proceſſions &amp; Litanies, by which Gods glory is manifeſted, and his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:43743:255"/> have been often prevented. Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Proceſſions, we read in the Scripture, how acceptable to Chriſt was the proceſſion of the children &amp; people of Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 21.</note> when he entred into that Citie, vpon Palmes-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, throwing down their garments before him, carrying braunches of Palmes, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Hoſanna: in imitation of which, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, vpon that day, makes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proceſſions, by carrying the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtrawing of flowers, and bearing of Palmes. All which is done to the honour of Chriſt. In the old Teſtament alſo, we read of the ſolemn Proceſſions, that were made with the Ark about Iericho, Ioſue 6. And of diverſe others, when the Ark was carried from place to place, 2. Kings 6.7. and 3. Kings 8. They were vſed alſo, in the Primitive Church, as Baronius shewes,<note place="margin">Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius tom. <hi>1.</hi> anno <hi>48.</hi> Baſil. ep. <hi>63.</hi>
                  </note> and mention is made of them, in the Councel of Laodicea, c. 17. In theſe Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were oftentimes ſaid Litanies or short prayers, by which God has been often paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed: of which S. Baſil the great ſaith: <hi>Cum Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanias dicimus, non humanis verbis, ſed oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Spiritus, Deum placamus.</hi> When we ſay the Litanies, we pacify God, not with humane words, but by the Oracles of the holy Spirit. By theſe Proceſſions &amp; Litanies,<note place="margin">Spond. an. <hi>590.</hi> n. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> or publique ſupplications, the City of Rome was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly delivered from a furious plague, in the time of S. Gregory the great: and the City of Vienne in France from horrible earthquakes, in the time of S. Mamertus Bishop of that City:
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:43743:255"/> as may be ſeen in the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory.<note place="margin">Spond. an <hi>475.</hi> n. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> Therefore, Proceſſions &amp; Litanies are moſt ancient &amp; laudable; they tend much to the glory of God, &amp; ſtirring vp of devotion. And the Litanies are ſo far from being blaſphemous (as you very rashly call them) that they are Oracles of the holy Ghoſt, by which Gods iudgments have been often prevented.</p>
               <p>For the multitude of Mediators &amp; Advocats, which you renounce, the Catholique Church acknowledgeth but <hi>one</hi> Mediator, who has redeemd all mankind, by the shedding of his pretious bloud, to witt, Ieſus-Chriſt. And for the Saints, she acknowledgeth them to be only Mediators &amp; Advocats to pray for her, as the faithfull living pray for others: which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes nothing againſt the one Meditation &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Ieſus-Chriſt, as is evident to any man, who has common ſenſe. Therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit you renounce the mediation of the Saints, to pray for you; yet the Catholique Church will not renounce the Prayers of the Saints.</p>

It is ſufficient to know, that they were obſerved in the moſt holy &amp; Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times: and it may be truly ſaid, that theſe Manyfold Orders of the Catholique Church are much more commendable, then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfold

If you deteſt it as vnneceſſary, then you goe againſt our Saviours Commiſſion, &amp; the holy Fathers. For Chriſt, having made the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſpiritual Iudges, and having given them power to bind &amp; looſe from ſins, it followes neceſſarly, that the people muſt confeſſe their ſins to them, or elſe their power had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them in vain; neither could they abſolve the people, from what they knew not.

By this alone Teſtimony of S.

The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique doctrine of Confeſſion is a truth ſo engraffed in the hearts of Chriſtians, and the practice of it brings ſo great comfort, that even theſe, who are brought vp in a contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,

               <p>Here in the firſt place, you follow your two Maſters Luther &amp; Calvin, by calling the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of the Catholiques, deſperate, and vncertain,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de penit. c. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> which Cardinal Bellarmin reckons, not amongſt their doctrines, but amongſt their deceits &amp; calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nies.

Secondly, it is falſly called vncertain: For albeit the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques teach, that no man, without divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne revelation, can know the truth of his own repentance, by the certainty of divine faith; yet he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>all, but alſo every particular point; yet you call their faith general and doubtſome: becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe they will not beleeve that, which God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reveal'd, to witt, your ſpecial faith, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foolish fancie, by which every one of you beleeves, that your ſins are forgiven, and that you are of the number of the predeſtinate, and by which you think to be iuſtifyed. But the Catholiques have no reaſon to beleeve ſuch a ſpecial faith: becauſe, (as it has been shewed above) it is nothing but meer preſumption, and is condemned as a <hi>falſe faith,</hi> &amp; a <hi>private fancie,</hi> by a famous Proteſtant, and it is ſo groundleſſe &amp; doubtſome, that it brings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe among your ſelves, who follow cloſely your principles, into great perturbation of mind, and ſome into deſperation. All which,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:43743:258"/> as alſo the truth and certainty of the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques iuſtifying faith, may be ſeen handled abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, in the matter of Iuſtification, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the 17.

               <p>After you have deteſted Confeſſion, and blamed the Catholiques, for requireing ſo much Contrition: now you deteſt Satisfaction, and ſo you renounce all the three parts of the Sacrament of Penance: but you do this with as little reaſon; as you have done the reſt: For, by Satisfactions, the Catholiques vnderſtand ſome laborious works, ſuch as Prayer, A mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, faſting, which are offered vp to God, in Satisfaction, for the temporal punishment due to our ſins, after the guilt and eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment are taken away, by the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal abſolution: which doctrine is moſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> that they have blaſphemed things, as S. Iude ſpeaks, whereof they are ignorant: and have
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:43743:259"/> made many thowſands do the ſame. What the Catholique Doctors intend by <hi>opus operatum,</hi> has been above shewed, pag. 202. to witt that the Sacraments of the new Law doe conferre grace, by the work wrought: that is by the power of the Sacramental action, inſtituted by Chriſt to that effect; and not by the merit of the Miniſter, or Receiver of the Sacraments: which is a moſt certain truth, as may be ſeen above explain'd, and confirmed at more length. This is a better work wrought, then the work of your Covenant, which has wrought much miſchief in great Britain.</p>
               <p>You are not content to renounce all works of duty, which are commanded, by denying the poſſibility of keeping the commandments; vnleſſe you renounce alſo works of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not commanded, but Counſelled, which the Catholiques call works of Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation. That there are ſuch works moſt lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable &amp; commendable, albeit you deteſt them, is evident by the Scriptures &amp; Fathers. For Virginity is not a command, but a Counſel: and is more perfect then Matrimony. Of this S. Paul giveth teſtimony ſaying: <hi>As concerning Virgins, a commandment of our Lord I have not, but Counſel I give, as having obtaynd mercy of our Lord to be faithfull.</hi> 1.

<pb n="504" facs="tcp:43743:260"/> them, when they are performed by others. The truth is ſo clearly here on the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques ſide againſt you; that it extorted a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from one of your own Coate, M. <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> a Proteſtant Miniſter, who, having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a little of the foreſaid Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and of the great rewards, that are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them, concludes in theſe words: <hi>Theſe are Gods Counſels,</hi>

               <p>You deteſt next the Catholique doctrine of Merits, which, you would make the ignorant beleeve, to be moſt abſurd; and indeed ſo it will ſeem to any, who lookes vpon it, through your Miniſterial ſpectacles, repreſenting it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as if the Catholiques taught, that good works, done by the force of Nature, and not by the power of Chriſts grace, were merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of Heaven, or that they taught, that they were to be ſaved by their own merits, and not by the merits of Chriſt: whereas indeed the Catholique doctrine is iuſt contrary, as may be ſeen in the Councel of Trent, ſeſſ. 6. can. 1. 10. 32 33. and in the 8. Chapter of that ſame Seſſion; of which matter ſomething has been touched above pag. 190. 191. and before that p. 171. where ſome words of the Councel, to this purpoſe, are cited. The true ſenſe, then of the Catholiques, concerning Merits, is, that good works done by a perſon in the ſtate of grace, and performed by the power &amp;
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:43743:260"/> ſtrength of Chriſts grace, have a reward of eternal life, by Chriſts goodneſſe, promiſed vnto them. The Scripture is ſo clear for this truth, that it is wonder, how any perſon can doubt of it it Our Saviour ſaith. <hi>Be glad, and reioyce: for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> Math. 5.12. Again: <hi>call the workmen, and pay them their hire.</hi> ch. 20. 8. S. Paul ſaith: <hi>God will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every one, according to his works, to them truly, that, according to patience in good works, ſeek glory &amp; incorruption, life eternal.</hi> Rom. 2.6.7. <hi>who ſowes in the Spirit, shall reap in the Spirit life everlaſting.</hi> 1. Cor. 6.8. And of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he ſaith: <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reſt, there is laid vp for me a Crowne of Iuſtice,</hi> &amp;c. 2.

Whereby it is as evident, as the Sun, that life eternal is the reward and hire of good works, and therefore, they are meritorious: for rewards are not given, but to merits. The holy Fathers are ſo much for this doctrine, that Luther &amp; diverſe Proteſtants doe cenſure them for it:<note place="margin">Prot.

                  <hi>I profeſſe ſincerely, I should be ſo far from enforceing Papiſts to renounce the Doctrine of Merits, that I am reſolved to ſuffer a thowſand deaths, rather, then abiure ſo manifeſt a truth, according to the ſenſe, wherein they explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or affirm ſo great &amp; manifeſt an Errour, according to the ſenſe, wherein we explain our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</hi> Thus he.

               <p>You renounce alſo Pardons or Indulgences: but, when theſe are known, according to the Catholiques ſenſe, they are not ſuch Boggles, as you would make them appeare to children: For theſe are only remiſſions of the temporal penance or paines, which, for the moſt part, remain to be ſuffered for the Satisfaction of ſin, after the guilt thereof is taken away. That the Church has this power, is proved by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Whatſoever thou shalt looſe in earth, shall be alſo looſed in heaven.</hi> And by the practiſe of S. Paul, who pardoned the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Corinthian of the reſt of his penance. 2. Cor. 10. where he ſaith, he pardoned him, <hi>in

Now what was the practice of the Primitive Church, is ſo clear, that it needs no proof.<note place="margin">Hier. epiſt. <hi>17.</hi> ad Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellam.</note> S. Hierom ſaith it would be longſome to recount, through every age, from the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, to the preſent time, the number of Bishops, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and eloquent perſons, who have come to Ieruſalem, to adore Chriſt in theſe holy places, &amp;c. And again. <hi>The Iewes of old did worship the Holy of Holyes: becauſe there were the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins, the propitiatorie and Ark of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Manna, the Rod of Aaron &amp; the golden
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:43743:262"/> Altar. But does not the Sepulchre of Chriſt ſeem more Venerable vnto thee, the glory of whoſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre was foretould by Eſay. And his Sepulchre shall be glorious.</hi> &amp;c. The peregrinations alſo to viſit the Sepulchres of S. Peter &amp; S.

Theſe devout Pilgrimages, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit holy places &amp; Saints reliques, by which God &amp; his Saints are much honoured, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion augmented, &amp; many benefits often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind, are much more commendable, then your intended warlik peregrinations, with your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting Armies, to deſtroy theſe holy places &amp; Monuments of piety. But you have come far short of your reckoning. How much are you degenerated from the piety of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, who built diverſe Hoſpitals in the way to Rome, enriching them with revenues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Pilgrins, who were going to viſit the bodyes of the holy Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Baron. ad an num <hi>845.</hi> ex Concilio Melden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi c. <hi>15.</hi>

               <p>Then, for <hi>Stations,</hi> which you have made the people abiure with implicit faith, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve put many of your beſt Miniſterial heads to a ſtand; not being able to shew, what they are as is known by many experiences. But, albeit you ignorantly abiure them; yet they are moſt ancient and commendable. Tertullian makes mention of them,<note place="margin">Tert. in lib. de fug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:43743:262"/> And in many other places he ſpeaks of them. They were nothing elſe, but Vigils or dayly watches of people, continually praying in the time of Solemn faſts. Which were called <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> by a Similitude drawn from an Armie, wherein there are alwayes ſome appointed to keep watch, when others are at reſt. So in the Catholique Church, which is the Army of the living God, there are ſome ordain'd to ſtand watching &amp; praying for the reſt. What evil is in this, or rather is there not great good in it? But thereafter, the Stations were not only vſed vpon faſting dayes, but alſo vpon Sundayes &amp; Feaſts, as may be ſeen more amply in Cardinal Bellarmin. lib. 2. de bonis operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. c. 22. And it is related in the life of S.

Clement shewes, that S. Mathew did ordain the manner of conſecrating it. And S.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:43743:263"/> Baſil the great reckons it among the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Traditions. As for the effects of it,<note place="margin">Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s lib. <hi>8.</hi> Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licarum inſtit. c. <hi>35.</hi> Baſil. lib. de Spiritu S. c. <hi>27.</hi> Epiph. haereſ. <hi>30.</hi> Hieron. in vita Hilario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.

This is ſufficient, to shew, that the vſe of holy water is moſt ancient, and profitable; which might be shown alſo for other effects, as of taking away venial ſins. But we proceed to the reſt.</p>
               <p>After your deteſting of holy water, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the Catholiques conſecration of Bells to Gods ſervice: which is done, by ſprinkling of holy water vpon them, and by vſeing ſome other Ceremonies, for which you call it ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing of Bells, whereby ſome are brought to think, that the Catholiques do really baptize them: So that M. <hi>Sutcliff</hi> accuſeth them, for abuſeing thereby, the Sacrament of Baptiſm. To which D. Kelliſon anſwers; that the ſaid M. Sutcliff is very ridiculous; if he think, that the Catholique Church baptizeth Belles, as she doth litle Infants: or that she ſaith to the Bell: <hi>I Baptize thee in name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore, if he look into the <hi>Pontiflcal,</hi> he shall find, that this bleſſing of belles conſiſteth only in ſprinkling holy water, prayers &amp; other ceremonies, by which the Bell is dedicated to Gods ſervice. And, although the people, in ſome places (as in France) call it baptizing of
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:43743:264"/> Bells; yet this baptizing is only a Benediction, or Dedication of the Bell.<note place="margin">kelliſons Reply to Sutcliff</note> Thus the Doctor, with much more to this purpoſe: as may be ſeen in his Reply, p. 348 This bleſſing &amp; hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Bells is much better, then your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers vnhallowing, &amp; ſelling of them: wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich Sacrilege God did viſibly punish, when, at the beginning of your pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he cauſed a ship loaden with the lead, Bells, and other Ornaments of ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which they were ſending beyond ſeas, to be ſold, to plump down ſuddainly, on a very faire day, in the road of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> whereby all the perſons &amp; goods within it were loſt: as is known by the relation of ſome old credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons, yet living. That was indeed, in ſome ſenſe, <hi>Dipping</hi> of Bells!</p>
               <p>You abiure coniuring of Spirits or Exorciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, by which the Catholique Church, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the name of Ieſus-Chriſt, &amp; of his Saints, commands &amp; expells Devils out of perſons poſſeſſed.

Luther indeed your firſt Apoſtle tryed to caſt out a Devil from a certain woman, a Diſciple of his; but that enterpriſe ſucceeded ſo ill with him, that he himſelf was in great danger to be killed by the Devil, and left behind him a very evil odour: as Staphylus, who was preſent, doth relate.</p>

                  <hi>by the word of God and prayer.</hi> The hallowing of Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to pious vſes is not ſuperſtition; but the contrary practice is profanation. The Popes worldly Monarchie, as you call it, has agreed better with all the Monarchs of the world, and that for many ages; then your worldly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy has conſiſted with one or two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, in one corner of the world, for the few years you have laſted. And the Sacred Hierarchie of the Church, which you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all modeſtie, call wicked, has not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch wicked effects, for the ſpace of 16. hundred yeares and above; as the Anarchy of your Preſbytery has done in leſſe, then the ſpace of twentie. You abiure alſo the three ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vowes of voluntary chaſtity, poverty &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which have been shown above, to be works of greater perfection. This shewes that the Prophet Eſay did not mean of you, but of the members of the true Church, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of them,<note place="margin">

The myſterious ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of this ceremony may be ſeen in <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> lib. 2. <hi>de Monachis</hi> cap. 40. And, albeit no other reaſon be brought, the very venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble antiquity of it alone is ſufficient, to shew, that theſe shavelings of ſundry ſorts, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then your <hi>new Round-heads of ſundry ſects.</hi> Then you deteſt, according to your phraſe, the Popes corrupted &amp; bloodie decrees, made at Trenf. But that is ordinary for all Noveliſts to carrie hatred to, and calumniate theſe Sacred General Councels, by whoſe authority, their corrupted errors are condemned: ſo did the Arians to the great Councel of Nice. That which you ſpeak of a cruel &amp; bloody Band, ſubſcrybed there, is a meer calumnie; for no ſuch thing was done there. But indeed it is no calumnie, to call your <hi>Covenant,</hi> which was approved and ſubſcrybed at your Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> a <hi>cruel and bloudy Band:</hi> as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects have proved. It is by ſuch cruel and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Bands, that falſe religions muſt be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or rather enforced againſt mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; But the Catholique Church, truſting in the promiſe of Chriſts aſſiſtance, and being armed with the force of truth, goes on vpon other principles. You are pleaſed alſo not only to deteſt the Decrees of the Councel of Trent; but likwiſe the ſubſcrybers &amp; Approvers the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, whom you call Conſpirators againſt the Kirk of God. But albeit your paſſion leads you to deteſt their doctrines; yet civility should oblige you not to deteſt their perſons; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:43743:266"/> ſince ſome Approvers thereof are the moſt Eminent Princes of the world, to whom you ought to carrie reſpect. And whereas, you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vpon you, the name &amp; authority of the Church of God; it has been shewed above, that your Kirk has lyen too long <hi>hid,</hi> to be the Kirk of God. You call your Kirk a Reformed Kirk; but it ought rather to be called a new formed Kirk, becauſe it is ſubſtantially diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the old: and it is ſo far from being truly Reformed, that it is deformed in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points of the Chriſtian religion, as we have ſeen, concerning the Apoſtles Creed, our Lords prayer, the Commandments &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; beſides many other ſubſtantial articles above touched. That, which you ſay of the Popes Vain Allegories, Rites &amp; Signs, is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous. It is known that theſe Allegories, which you blame, were vſed by the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; particularly by S. Auguſtin, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in the Allegorical ſenſe of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: whoſe Allegories are not vain, but moſt grave, and will be preferred by all ſound iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to your Miniſters vain Tropes and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, againſt the clear Scriptures; as we have ſeen in the matter of the holy Sacrament. Of Traditions, we have ſpoke ſufficiently above. All the reſt that followes in your Covenant, (excepting the two vntruths touched above in the firſt ſection, and your Oath for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings authority) is nothing, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of moſt fearfull and horrible Oaths whereby you tye yourſelves, vnder higheſt
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:43743:266"/> curſes, and paines, to maintaine theſe your groſſe errors and Hereſies; which ought rather to be deplored, then confuted; eſpecially ſince you are begun to find the effects of theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly collected the principall obſervations, which my Catholique Friend and I made vpon the Covenant, although I have paſſed by many things, that were in his papers; that this book might not exceed the iuſt bigneſſe. But by what has been ſaid, may be in ſome meaſure ſeen, what counterfeit mettal the Covenant is, and what a maſſe of Errors and old condemned hereſies it containes, ioynd with blaſphemous Execrations of the principal points of the holy Catholique faith; and what an Idol the ſimple people was made to adore. It is truly to be regrated, that our Nation, which for the ſpace of 14. hundred years did profeſſe the Catholique faith, with ſo great pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and did propagate it abroad, with ſo great glory &amp; zeal, of which many Monuments are extant in forreign Nations, should be now ſo blinded with Error, and miſcarried by paſſion, againſt the truth; that, for the moſt part, if it were in their power, they are no leſſe Zealous to extirpate it.<note place="margin">Baron. tom. <hi>5.</hi> in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plem. ad annum <hi>429.</hi>
                  </note> The moſt famous Cardinal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius gives this excellent teſtimonie of the ancient Scottish Chriſtians. <hi>Theſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who received the Goſpel firſt from Pope Victor, and their firſt Bishop from Pope Celeſtin, by whom they were all made Chriſtians, did profitt ſo much through the grace of Chriſt, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

It may pleaſe God, in his own ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, to diſpell the clouds of darkneſſe, and Miniſterial calumnies, and make the light of truth appeare again vnto this Nation; and turn their hearts vnto the right way, from wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich they have gone very far aſtray. And that this may be granted, all ought to pray, eſpecially theſe, whom God has called lately in this Nation, vnto the knowledge of the truth. With the concurrence of which deſire, I would make an end, if the Renounciation of the Covenant, shown by my Catholique friend, to me, and ſome other new Converted Catholiques, wherein there is an Antitheſis almoſt in every point, between the Catholique and Preſbyterian doctrine, were not thought fitting, to be here ſubioynd; with which we shall conclude.</p>
